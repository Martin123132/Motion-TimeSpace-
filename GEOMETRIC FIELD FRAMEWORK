THE MOTION–TIMESPACE (MTS) GEOMETRIC FIELD FRAMEWORK
A Unified Nonlinear Geometric Field Model
Martin Ollett (2025)


1. Overview
-----------

The Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) Framework proposes that physical structure,
stability and curvature arise from a single nonlinear geometric field
equation. The model combines soliton formation, curvature persistence,
and shock-limited flow into one coherent system defined by minimal
geometric principles.

The theory relies on three core elements:
• A nonlinear field equation with exponent 4/3
• A harmonic geometric regulator ΦG
• A curvature-persistence constant Γκ connecting micro- and macro-scale structure


2. The MTS Master Field Equation
--------------------------------

The fundamental field ψ(x, t) obeys the nonlinear, damped wave equation:

    ∂²ψ/∂t²  −  c² ∇²ψ  +  λ · sgn(ψ) · |ψ|^(4/3)  +  γ · ∂ψ/∂t  =  0

where:
• c  is the invariant maximum propagation speed
• λ  is the geometric tension coefficient
• γ  is the geometric damping coefficient

This equation supports localized solitons, stable standing waves, and
bounded shock-regularized solutions.


3. Origin of the Nonlinear Exponent (4/3)
-----------------------------------------

Soliton solutions of a nonlinear wave equation require the total field
energy to be scale-invariant under spatial dilation.

For the general energy functional:

    E ∼ ∫ ( |∇ψ|²  +  |ψ|^n ) d³x

scale invariance demands:

    3 − 2  =  3(n − 1)

which gives:

    n = 4/3

This exponent also reflects the ratio of spacetime to spatial dimension:

    n = D_spacetime / D_spatial  =  4 / 3

Thus 4/3 is the unique exponent producing stable, non-dispersive structures
in a 3D space embedded in 4D propagation geometry.


4. The Harmonic Regulator ΦG
----------------------------

The geometric regulator ΦG arises from the requirement of self-similarity,
harmonic balance, and geometric stability:

    ΦG² = ΦG + 1

which yields:

    ΦG = (1 + √5) / 2  ≈ 1.61803398875

ΦG appears as the internal scaling factor for harmonic organization and
recursive geometric structure in the field.


5. Geometric Damping and Tension Coefficients
---------------------------------------------

Dimensional analysis and harmonic scaling determine the forms of the
damping γ and tension λ parameters.

    γ  =  ΦG · √( c⁵ / (G · ħ) )
    λ  =  ΦG³ · (c³ / G) · γ

These coefficients link the geometric regulators (ΦG, 2π) to the physical
constants ħ, G, and c.


6. The Curvature Persistence Constant Γκ
----------------------------------------

Large-scale curvature behaviour is governed by a dimensionless constant
Γκ, constructed from the harmonic regulator ΦG and the rotational
folding factor 2π.

    Γκ = ΦG² / (2π)^(10/3)

Using:

    ΦG² = 2.6180339887
    (2π)^(10/3) ≈ 661.3

gives:

    Γκ ≈ 3.96 × 10⁻³

This constant governs slow curvature attenuation observed in cosmic-scale
dynamics and appears in the macroscopic limit of the MTS field.


7. Shock-Limited Dynamics and the PGF Equation
----------------------------------------------

In high-gradient regions, the nonlinear tension term λ|ψ|^(4/3) causes
steepening, while the Laplacian term −c²∇²ψ produces wave breaking.

The damping term γ ∂ψ/∂t prevents singularities by enforcing curvature
saturation. In this limit, the full MTS equation reduces to a flux-limited
first-order form, previously identified as the PGF equation.

The PGF thus represents the shock-regulated limit of the master equation,
and provides stable, bounded flow profiles.


8. Unified Interpretation
-------------------------

The framework is constructed from three geometric principles:

• Dimensional balance (giving the exponent 4/3)
• Harmonic self-similarity (giving ΦG)
• Rotational attenuation (giving Γκ)

These constants determine the structure, stability, and large-scale
behaviour of the MTS field.


9. Summary
----------

The Motion–TimeSpace Framework establishes:

• A single nonlinear geometric field equation
• A unique exponent (4/3) required for stable solitons
• A harmonic self-similarity regulator ΦG
• A dimensionless curvature persistence constant Γκ
• A shock-limited reduction to the PGF equation

Together these elements form a coherent geometric model linking particle-
scale stability, nonlinear field dynamics, and cosmic curvature behaviour.
