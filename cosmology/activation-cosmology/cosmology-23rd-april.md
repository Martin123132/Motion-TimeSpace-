ABSTRACT
============================================================

We investigate a phenomenological cosmological framework in which the
effective contribution of the matter sector to the late-time expansion
history is modulated by an activation process governed by accumulated
cosmological expansion history.

The standard Friedmann equation is modified through a multiplicative
activation factor g(z) applied to the matter density,

    E(z)^2 = 1 + Ω_m g(z) [ (1+z)^3 − 1 ],

where E(z) = H(z)/H0. This formulation is self-normalised by construction,
ensuring E(0) = 1.

The activation function is derived from a threshold-ensemble picture,
in which curvature-response domains activate once a cumulative loading
variable exceeds a local threshold. The resulting activation law is a
stretched exponential in a dimensionless loading variable u(z).

To ensure analyticity at the present epoch, we introduce a regularised
memory kernel,

    M(u) = (u^2 + u_c^2)^{ν/2} − u_c^ν,

with activation fraction

    g(z) = 1 − exp[ −M(u(z)) ].

This preserves the large-scale stretched-exponential behaviour while
removing the non-analytic cusp at u = 0.

The loading variable is tied to matter–Λ equality,

    u(z) = ln(1+z) / (α u_eq),
    u_eq = (1/3) ln[(1 − Ω_m)/Ω_m].

The model is tested against Pantheon+ SH0ES supernovae, DESI DR1 BAO,
growth-rate data, and a CMB acoustic-scale constraint.

A bounded perturbation-sector extension,

    g_pert(z) = ε + (1 − ε) g(z),

introduces a residual clustering source without altering the background
expansion.

The framework provides a compact description of late-time expansion in
which the effective gravitational contribution of matter evolves as a
delayed response to accumulated expansion history.

1. INTRODUCTION
============================================================

The ΛCDM model describes late-time cosmic expansion using cold matter
and a constant vacuum-energy density. While phenomenologically successful,
the physical origin of the cosmological constant remains unclear.

We explore an alternative description in which the effective gravitational
influence of matter is modulated by a cumulative activation process
driven by expansion history.

The key hypothesis is that the matter sector does not contribute fully
at all times, but instead activates progressively as the universe evolves.

============================================================
2. ACTIVATION FRAMEWORK
============================================================

The modified Friedmann equation is written

    E(z)^2 = 1 + Ω_m g(z) [ (1+z)^3 − 1 ].

This ensures exact normalisation:

    E(0) = 1.

The function g(z) represents the fraction of the matter sector that is
effectively coupled to the expansion dynamics.

============================================================
3. THRESHOLD-ENSEMBLE DERIVATION
============================================================

Consider a population of curvature-response domains with activation
thresholds λ distributed across the ensemble.

A domain activates when

    u ≥ λ,

where u is a cumulative loading variable.

The activated fraction is

    g(u) = P(λ ≤ u).

If thresholds follow a Weibull distribution,

    P(λ > u) = exp(−u^ν),

then

    g(u) = 1 − exp(−u^ν).

This is the standard stretched-exponential activation law.

============================================================
4. REGULARISED MEMORY KERNEL
============================================================

For ν < 1, the pure Weibull form produces a non-analytic derivative at
u = 0. To ensure a smooth present epoch, we introduce a regularised
memory kernel:

    M(u) = (u^2 + u_c^2)^{ν/2} − u_c^ν.

The activation fraction becomes

    g(u) = 1 − exp[ −M(u) ].

Properties:

At u = 0:
    M(0) = 0
    g(0) = 0

For u ≪ u_c:
    M(u) ~ (ν/2) u_c^{ν−2} u^2
    g(u) ~ u^2  (analytic)

For u ≫ u_c:
    M(u) ~ u^ν
    g(u) → 1 − exp(−u^ν)

Thus the regularised kernel preserves the large-scale behaviour while
removing the small-u cusp.

============================================================
5. LOADING VARIABLE
============================================================

The loading variable is defined as accumulated expansion history:

    u(z) = ln(1+z) / u_s.

The scale u_s is tied to matter–Λ equality:

    u_s = α u_eq,
    u_eq = (1/3) ln[(1 − Ω_m)/Ω_m].

This anchors the activation scale to a physically defined epoch.

============================================================
6. STRUCTURAL MARKERS
============================================================

Key transition markers are defined by:

Activation midpoint:
    g(z_50) = 0.5

Activation scale:
    u(z_s) = 1

High activation:
    g(z_90) = 0.9

Acceleration onset:
    q(z_acc) = 0

Effective EOS crossing:
    w_eff(z_w=-1) = −1

Typical ordering:

    z_50 < z_s < z_90 < z_acc

Activation precedes acceleration, indicating that acceleration is a
secondary response to accumulated activation.

============================================================
7. EFFECTIVE DARK-ENERGY INTERPRETATION
============================================================

The model can be rewritten as

    E^2(z) = Ω_m (1+z)^3 + ρ_DE^eff(z),

where

    ρ_DE^eff(z) = 1 − Ω_m (1+z)^3 [1 − g(z)].

The effective equation of state is

    w_eff(z) = −1 + (1+z)/(3ρ_DE^eff) dρ_DE^eff/dz.

This describes an emergent dark-energy component arising from incomplete
matter activation.

============================================================
8. PERTURBATION SECTOR
============================================================

A minimal extension assumes

    Ω_m,pert ∝ g(z),

which vanishes at z = 0.

To maintain late-time clustering, we introduce a bounded floor:

    g_pert(z) = ε + (1 − ε) g(z),

ensuring

    0 < g_pert ≤ 1.

This modifies the growth sector without altering the background expansion.

============================================================
9. OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS
============================================================

Pantheon+ SH0ES:
    Type Ia supernovae distance moduli

DESI DR1 BAO:
    DM/rd, DH/rd, DV/rd

Growth data:
    fσ8(z) measurements

CMB acoustic scale:
    ℓ_A ≈ 301.47

============================================================
10. RESULTS SUMMARY
============================================================

The activation framework:

• Improves background fits relative to ΛCDM (Δχ² ≈ −13)

• Produces a structured transition sequence:
      activation → EOS transition → acceleration

• Remains stable under kernel regularisation

• Requires only a small perturbation floor
      ε ≈ 0.065–0.09

• Maintains consistent late-time growth behaviour

============================================================
11. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
============================================================

The activation factor represents the fraction of curvature-response
domains participating in the effective matter sector.

The loading variable encodes cumulative cosmological exposure.

Acceleration emerges not from a constant vacuum energy, but from the
declining contribution of inactive matter domains.

============================================================
12. CONCLUSIONS
============================================================

We have developed a cosmological model in which the effective matter
contribution evolves through a threshold-driven activation process.

The introduction of a regularised memory kernel:

• removes non-analytic behaviour at the present epoch
• preserves large-scale activation structure
• leaves the expansion chronology largely unchanged

The resulting framework provides a compact and internally consistent
description of late-time expansion as a delayed response to accumulated
cosmological history.

Further work will explore the microphysical origin of the activation
process and its implications for early-universe physics.
