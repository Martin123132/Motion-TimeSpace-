MTS Galaxy Law
The Motion–Timespace (MTS) Galaxy Law:
A Transport–Response Framework for Disk Galaxies
Version 8 
Abstract
We present a transport-based derivation of galaxy rotation curves within the Motion–Timespace (MTS) framework. A curvature–exchange field, emerging from a coarse-grained microscopic motion field ψ, drives a support field whose radial transport produces a closed-form rotation law. The resulting background law is cosmologically normalised and contains no free parameters on a clean subset of disk galaxies.
First-order corrections arise from structural deviations, specifically gas depletion and bulge concentration. The correct governing variable is an integrated transport memory, producing a zero-parameter saturating modification of the effective transport scale. Residuals reorganise into distinct response families characterised by different radial kernels.
Late-type galaxies (LTGs) follow a unified transport law with memory-driven corrections. Early-type galaxies (ETGs) form a multi-family, multi-sign response sector governed by a layered four-condition intersection structure. The ETG outer gate factorises exactly into a load coordinate X₀ᵤₜ and a disk-carried cancellation coordinate Rᵈ, with the viable single-channel H+ branch admitting a full structural reduction to a density-plus-geometry disk-force law.
New in v8: The outer threshold structure is characterised as a radial law u(r) = [V²obs(r) − 0.5V²disk(r) − 0.7V²bul(r)] / (Γ0 r Rmax). The outer viability boundary δu = 1 − u = (Xcrit − Xout)/Xcrit is confirmed as the exact normalised boundary margin for all 16 ETGs. Buffered outer-viable ETGs share a common rescaled radial approach profile near the u=1 threshold. A joint (S, u_out) map of the full 175-galaxy SPARC sample confirms the LTG/ETG population structure. The LTG outer route split (81 low-load, 77 buffered) mirrors the ETG structure, with the boundary approach organised by f_gas,out − 0.869 Δ (permutation p = 0.008). Updated in v9: The ETG buffered residual mode is best organised by Z = log(Rb/δu) + 0.30 S (LOO = 0.0017, verified). The LTG inner admissibility rule is confirmed as h/r_out ≤ 0.3168 (N=141, Priority J closed). Two LTG H+ candidates are identified: NGC2841 and NGC4157 both pass the inner feasibility screen (S < 1.70, Ω_in > 1, Umax ≥ U*).
1.  Introduction
Galaxy rotation curves exhibit systematic deviations from baryonic expectations. Existing approaches either introduce additional matter components or modify gravitational dynamics. The Motion–Timespace (MTS) framework treats galaxy dynamics as a macroscopic transport response to a cosmological curvature–motion background, requiring neither dark matter nor modified gravity.
This work derives the galaxy law within the MTS framework, tests it directly against raw rotation curve data from the SPARC catalogue, and identifies the minimal correction structure required by observations. We show that the LTG sector admits a closed first-order description while the ETG sector requires a structurally distinct layered treatment whose outer gate can be written as an exact geometric condition in the (X₀ᵤₜ, Rᵈ) plane.
2.  The MTS Framework
2.1  Emergent geometry
A scalar field ψ defines an emergent metric via coarse-grained gradient covariance:
gμν = ημν + ⟨∂μψ, ∂νψ⟩
2.2  Curvature–exchange field
A scalar Γ = F[ψ, g] encodes curvature–motion exchange. ψ is a fundamental motion field whose linear modes correspond to radiation-like behaviour and whose nonlinear localised configurations form stable matter-like structures. A secondary scalar Γ emerges dynamically as a curvature–memory field. The present work requires only: (i) the emergent metric from gradient covariance of ψ, and (ii) a curvature–exchange field Γ coupling to macroscopic transport.
3.  Transport Equation and Background Law
The transport equation is:
uμ ∇μχ + χ/τΓ = Γ0/4
In the stationary disk limit:
vΓ dχ/dr + χ/τΓ = Γ0/4
Defining L = vΓτΓ gives the background solution:
χ(r) = (Γ0/4) L (1 − e⁻ʳᴸᴸ)
Mapping to observables via V²(r) = V̅²har(r) + χ(r), using the photometric closure L = k(j̅har/V̅har,hmr) with k ≈ 0.9, and the cosmological normalisation Γ0 = cH₀/(8π), yields the zero-parameter background galaxy law. Working constants: H₀ = 67.9 km/s/Mpc, Γ0 ≈ 809.956 km²/s²/kpc.
4.  LTG Sector (Closed)
4.1  Photometric closure
For exponential disks, j̅har = 2hVφα, giving Lpred = 2kh ≈ 1.8h. This closure stabilises the scale law. The lag variable |ln(h/L)| collapses to a constant under photometric closure and loses independent physical meaning.
4.2  Transport memory law
The governing variable is: memory_load = (1 − fgas)(Router / h). The effective transport scale is:
Leff = Lpred [1 + S (1 − exp(−memory_load / S))],   S = (k/π)(Router / h)
4.3  Complete LTG law
V²(r) = V̅²har(r) + (Γ0) × Leff × [1 − exp(−(r/Leff)q)]
with q = 1 + nout (or q ≈ 0.77 globally). Performance on SPARC data:

Sample	n	Model	Median RMSE
Clean LTGs (b < 0.1)	137	Memory law, 0 params	20.60 km/s
All LTGs	174	Memory law, 0 params	29.44 km/s


5.  LTG/ETG Population Gate
ETGs are classified as such if ALL THREE hold simultaneously:
n̅obs < 0  ;  fbulge,outer > 0.155  ;  Δn < 0.24
Performance: ETG recall 16/16, LTG specificity 170/175, overall accuracy ≈ 97.4%. All results verified from raw files.
6.  ETG Response Sector — Overview
ETGs fail the LTG law in two independent ways simultaneously. They form a multi-family, multi-sign response sector. The complete ETG classification is organised by the four-condition intersection structure described in §7.
The five ETG families, organised by support signature ΔV²(r) = V²obs(r) − V̅²har(r):
H+ galaxies (single-channel): NGC2685, NGC3626, NGC3941 — sign-changing (ΔV²inn < 0, ΔV²out > 0), all four conditions satisfied.
H+ galaxy (two-channel): NGC4203 — sign-changing, outer capacity exceeded; two-channel required.
Boundary (class B): NGC3838 — profile-close to H+, inner/outer-feasible, sign-wrong only.
Class C: NGC4262 — profile-close, inner-feasible, sign-wrong and outer-wrong.
D1 (outer-capacity fail): NGC2824, NGC2859, NGC2974 — u > 1, Umax > U*.
D2 (double fail): NGC3945, NGC3998, NGC4278, NGC5582* — both u > 1 and Umax < U*.
E (wrong profile family): NGC3522, NGC6798, UGC6176 — outer/inner-feasible, large Δ, sign-wrong.
*NGC5582: S < 1.70 threshold miss. S = Q14/Δ = 1.647, Umax = 0.178 < U* = 0.202.
7.  Four-Condition Intersection Structure
The single-channel H+ branch is the intersection of four independent conditions. All four must hold simultaneously. This structure is verified from raw files across all 16 ETGs.
7.1  The four conditions
Condition 1 — Profile family (inner shape geometry)
Organised by (Δ, Q14) where Δ = 1 − Q12 is the half-point unfinished rise and Q14 = B(1/4) is the quarter-point completion. The viable locus: Δ ≈ 0.31–0.46, Q14 ≈ 0.19–0.26.
Condition 2 — Sign gate (inner baryonic amplitude)
Ωin = V̅²har(rin) / V²obs(rin) > 1
At fixed profile shape, the sign gate is decided by the absolute inner baryonic normalisation, not profile shape. The NGC3838/NGC3626 control pair demonstrates this directly: near-identical H(y) profiles (H(0.3) = 1.866 for both), but V̅har(rin) = 194 vs 284 km/s splits Ωin = 0.705 vs 1.316.
Condition 3 — Inner feasibility (S-threshold)
The completion variable S = Q14 / Δ organises Umax(B): the maximum unfinished-rise level the inner profile can sustain at any kernel width. The log-law:
Umax(B) ≈ 0.2324 − 0.0577 ln(S),   R² = 0.852,   Spearman r(log S, Umax) = −0.982
Threshold: S ≲ 1.70 → inner-feasible (15/16 correct; NGC5582 is the one borderline miss). Single-channel calibrators: S = 0.427, 0.534, 0.829. Inner-infeasible failures: S = 2.37, 6.82, 10.07, 30.63.
Condition 4 — Outer capacity (dynamical load)
u = (V²obs(rout) − V̅²har(rout)) / (Γ0 rout Rmax) ≤ 1
u is a dynamical-load variable, not a profile-shape variable. The best simple predictor is Xout = V²obs(rout)/(Γ0 rout), with Pearson r(Xout, u) = 0.972.
7.2  Independence of the four axes
The four conditions are genuinely independent. Key cross-correlations: r(Ωin, u) = −0.274, r(S, u) = 0.375, r(log S, u) = 0.515 (all weak). Inner failure is a profile-deformation problem; outer failure is a baryonic-retention problem. They are not the same mechanism.

All values verified from raw ETG files. rin values for NGC2685, NGC3626, NGC3941, NGC4203 are canonical locked values. Class A = single-channel H+ calibrator. *D2 = borderline miss on S-threshold.
8.  Inner Failure Routes
S = Q14/Δ spans three orders of magnitude across the ETG sample. The blow-up decomposes into two distinct routes, verified by decomposing ln S = ln Q14 − ln Δ relative to the single-channel calibrator baseline:
Route A — Quarter-point inflation (Δ-collapse subdominant): NGC2859 (S = 0.965), NGC3945 (S = 2.369).
Route B — Half-point collapse (Δ-collapse dominant): NGC3998 (S = 30.63), NGC4203 (S = 10.07). In both cases Δ = 1 − Q12 collapses toward zero while Q14 also rises.
Mixed (both contribute materially): NGC2974, NGC4278, NGC5582.
Supporting correlations: r(−lnΔ, Q14) = 0.922, r(−lnΔ, Q34) = 0.759, r(−lnΔ, Q90) = 0.678. The inner blow-up is not a late-only overshoot effect; the whole inner profile is pushed upward simultaneously, with the half-point collapse as the most explosive component of the ratio.
9.  Outer Gate Structure
9.1  Exact outer viability boundary
Starting from the exact identity:
u = (Xout − Bout) / Rmax,   Xout = V²obs(rout) / (Γ0 rout),   Bout = V̅²har(rout) / (Γ0 rout)
with Bout = Xout(Rd + Rb), the exact viability boundary u < 1 is:
Xout < Rmax / (1 − Rd − Rb)
where Rd = 0.5 V²disk(rout) / V²obs(rout) and Rb = 0.7 V²bul(rout) / V²obs(rout). The disk-only reduction Xout < Rmax/(1 − Rd) classifies all 16 ETGs correctly. This is a two-coordinate geometric condition, not a heuristic.
9.2  The radial load curve and exact boundary margin (new in v8)
The radial load is defined at every radius:
u(r) = [V²obs(r) − 0.5 V²disk(r) − 0.7 V²bul(r)] / (Γ0 r Rmax)
with Vdisk and Vbul taken from the high-resolution component files. This formula reproduces the v9 outer-table u(rout) values exactly to roundoff for all 16 ETGs (verified from raw files).
The exact algebraic identity relating the radial load to the outer boundary is:
u = Xout (1 − Rd − Rb) / Rmax = Xout / Xcrit
The outer slack variable is therefore:
δu ≡ 1 − u = (Xcrit − Xout) / Xcrit
This is exact (not approximate) and holds to roundoff for all 16 ETGs. δu is the normalised distance from the observed system to the solved outer boundary. The full δu table is given below.

Galaxy	Xout	Xcrit	u = Xout/Xcrit	δu = 1−u
NGC2685	1.0249	2.0576	0.4981	+0.5019
NGC2824	4.2190	3.2161	1.3118	−0.3118
NGC2859	3.9063	2.6255	1.4878	−0.4878
NGC2974	9.7415	2.4872	3.9166	−2.9166
NGC3522	1.7415	2.3550	0.7395	+0.2605
NGC3626	2.6473	3.6095	0.7334	+0.2666
NGC3838	1.8579	2.0343	0.9133	+0.0867
NGC3941	2.3075	2.9821	0.7738	+0.2262
NGC3945	4.8259	2.9590	1.6309	−0.6309
NGC3998	5.5674	2.1512	2.5880	−1.5880
NGC4203	3.3136	2.4777	1.3374	−0.3374
NGC4262	5.0106	2.2135	2.2636	−1.2636
NGC4278	7.2244	2.5695	2.8116	−1.8116
NGC5582	2.8725	1.9088	1.5049	−0.5049
NGC6798	1.6428	2.1599	0.7606	+0.2394
UGC6176	2.2398	2.5403	0.8817	+0.1183

9.3  Two viable outer routes and the crossing structure (new in v8)
For each outer-viable ETG, the outermost downward crossing of u(r) = 1 was identified from the raw files. Results confirm two structurally distinct viable outer routes:
Route 1 — Low-load (NGC2685): crosses u = 1 at r/rout ≈ 0.49. By rout the system sits deep inside the viable region (δu = 0.502). No reliance on baryonic cancellation.
Route 2 — Disk-buffered (NGC3626, NGC3838, NGC3522, NGC3941, NGC6798, UGC6176): crossing occurs late, at r/rout in the range 0.78–0.96. The observed rout sits only 5–28% beyond the threshold crossing. Viability is boundary-mediated through disk cancellation (Rd).

Galaxy	rout	u(rout)	Outermost u=1 crossing	r_cross/rout	δu
NGC2685	24.98	0.4981	12.22	0.489	0.5019
NGC3522	10.38	0.7395	8.94	0.861	0.2605
NGC3626	13.32	0.7334	11.24	0.843	0.2666
NGC3838	16.80	0.9133	16.01	0.953	0.0867
NGC3941	11.72	0.7738	9.94	0.848	0.2262
NGC6798	27.13	0.7606	21.23	0.783	0.2394
UGC6176	11.43	0.8817	10.65	0.932	0.1183

The branch split is cleanly confirmed: δu = 0.502 for the low-load system vs 0.087–0.267 for the buffered set. The outer control variable δu is the single exact scalar organising both routes.
9.4  Buffered branch radial profile structure (new in v8)
Buffered outer-viable ETGs share a common rescaled radial approach profile near the u = 1 threshold. When radius is scaled by the outermost crossing radius r_{u=1}, the six buffered galaxies collapse tightly in the neighbourhood of the threshold. On the all-six shared window 0.92 ≤ x = r/r_{u=1} ≤ 1.04, the common constrained quadratic local law is:
u(x) ≈ 1 − 1.588 (x−1) + 1.392 (x−1)²
Per-galaxy RMSE against this common law: NGC3522 = 0.013, NGC3626 = 0.002, NGC3838 = 0.012, NGC3941 = 0.009, NGC6798 = 0.023, UGC6176 = 0.005. The collapse is real but not exact; there is a residual one-mode structure (PC1 explains 99.87% of residual variance).
The dominant residual is a steepness mode: NGC3522 and NGC3838 are steeper-than-mean through the threshold; NGC3941 and NGC6798 are shallower. Individual quadratic local-slope coefficients (c1) range from −1.05 (NGC6798, shallowest) to −1.87 (NGC3522, steepest). NGC6798 is the shallow extreme of the same mode, not a separate branch (confirmed by 5-galaxy projection: mode-shape correlation 0.9994, NGC6798 residual variance explained by 5-gal mode = 99.63%).
The best empirical scalar organiser of the residual mode amplitude is Z = log(Rb/δu) + αS where S = Q14/Δ is the inner completion variable and α ≈ 0.30 (functional LOO ≈ 0.0017 on the shared window, verified from raw files). This improves on log(Rb/δu) alone (LOO = 0.00412) and on log(Rb·x_cross/δu) (LOO = 0.00374). The canonical reproducible pair(Rb, δu) LOO is 0.00539. The combined scalar beats the pair, confirming the mode is effectively one-dimensional in outer variables plus an inner shape correction. The inner correction is anchored by NGC3941 (highest S in the buffered set); the result survives rank-order and clipped-S robustness tests.
Note: The pair(Rb, δu) LOO value cited in earlier drafts as 0.022 cannot be reproduced from any consistent implementation; the canonical value is 0.00539. All LOO values in this section are verified from raw files using the canonical functional LOO implementation.
9.5  Near-boundary margins (disk-only, Xcrit−Xout)

Galaxy	Margin	Side	Note
NGC3626	+0.012	viable	tightest viable
UGC6176	+0.021	viable	
NGC3838	+0.030	viable	sign-wrong control
NGC3522	+0.089	viable	wrong profile family
NGC5582	−1.044	non-viable	closest fail
NGC4203	−1.184	non-viable	two-channel H+
NGC2824	−1.604	non-viable	
NGC2859	−1.640	non-viable	

9.6  Cancellation sector
The outer cancellation ratio R = Bout/Xout decomposes exactly as R = Rd + Rb. Across all 16 ETGs: r(Rd, R) = 0.905, r(Rb, R) = 0.544. In the moderate/high-load subset (Xout > 2): r(Rd, R) = 0.925, r(Rb, R) = 0.529. The cancellation sector is effectively disk-carried in the regime where it matters.
The outer bulge component Vbul(r) follows a Keplerian tail (Vbul ∝ r^{−1/2}, log-slope = −0.500 to 4 decimal places) for all six buffered ETGs at their outer edges. This is a common structural property of the buffered branch, not a coincidence of any individual galaxy.
10.  Outer Chain Reduction
10.1  Stage-4 disk force law
From the exact identity Rd = (0.5/Γ0 Xout) × V²disk(rout)/rout, the disk-only viability boundary is equivalent to:
Xout < Rmax + (0.5/Γ0) × V²disk(rout)/rout
The gate disk-force term is organised empirically by a density-plus-geometry law. Log-log fit results (full ETG sample, verified from raw files):

Sample	Intercept	a (density)	b (geometry)	R²
Full (n=16)	4.91	0.78	1.61	0.856
Xout > 2 (n=12)	5.17	0.69	1.55	0.876

10.2  Ideal exponential benchmark
For a razor-thin exponential disk, the exact Freeman disk rotation law gives H_exp(z) ∝ z^{3.4} over the ETG gate range 1.0 ≲ R/R90 ≲ 2.4 (exponent confirmed as 3.376 from direct evaluation). The empirical ETG exponents b ≈ 1.6–1.7 are materially softer. The correction factor C(z) ≡ Hreal(z)/Hexp(z) falls systematically with z.
10.3  Real-profile kernel law
Log-log fits of Hreal(z, η) against z = rout/R90 and η = Σdisk(rout)/⟨Σdisk⟩0.8-1.0 (full ETG sample):
log Hreal = 1.695 + 2.003 log(z) − 0.918 log(η),   R² = 0.931
High-load subset (Xout > 2, n=12): log Hreal = 1.737 + 2.239 log(z) − 0.583 log(η), R² = 0.930. K constants: Kfull = 0.03060, Khl = 0.03372 (verified from raw files).
10.4  The complete outer chain
Stage 1: Xout — dominates the empirical outer gate globally.
Stage 2: Bout/Xout = Rd + Rb — residual cancellation sector, effectively disk-only for non-low-load systems.
Stage 3: Rd = 0.5 V²disk(rout) / V²obs(rout) — disk-carried cancellation. AUC = 0.964 for buffered-branch identification.
Stage 4: V²disk(rout)/rout ∝ ⟨Σdisk⟩^a × z^b — local outer disk density and gate-position geometry.
11.  Joint (S, u_out) Population Map (new in v8)
Using the LTG-compatible inner operator and the outer load formula applied to all 175 SPARC LTGs and the 16 ETGs, the full joint (S, u_out) map confirms the population structure. Valid S values were obtained for 157–158 LTGs.
11.1  LTG quadrant counts (158 valid)

Region	LTGs	ETGs
S < 1.7, u_out < 1	132	7
S < 1.7, u_out ≥ 1	10	5
S ≥ 1.7, u_out < 1	12	0
S ≥ 1.7, u_out ≥ 1	4	4

The ETG-exclusive empty quadrant is S ≥ 1.7, u_out < 1: no ETGs occupy this region. The weak positive LTG coupling Pearson(log S, u_out) = +0.22 is confirmed from raw files. The viable H+ ETGs (NGC2685, NGC3626, NGC3941) sit inside the ordinary LTG occupied band in the (S, u_out) plane, with LTG nearest-neighbour distances 0.024–0.039.
11.2  Inner–outer factorisation
The inner (S) and outer (u_out) sectors are structurally factorised. Confirmed correlations:

Pair	Pearson	Spearman
log S vs log z	+0.023	−0.021
log S vs log η	−0.326	−0.132
log S vs log Hreal	+0.075	−0.065
log S vs log Xout	+0.534	+0.618

Only the S–Xout link is non-trivial (Pearson 0.534): inner-deformed galaxies tend toward higher outer load, but the cancellation mechanism remains separate. No kernel variable (z, η, Hreal) correlates with S beyond noise.
12.  LTG Outer Route Structure (new in v8)
Applying the same u(r) radial analysis to all 175 LTGs confirms that the same low-load / buffered route split exists in the LTG population.

Route	Count	Median u_out
Low-load (no downward crossing)	81	0.346
Buffered (has downward crossing)	77	0.568
Outer-infeasible (u_out ≥ 1)	17	—

The LTG buffered branch is structurally broader than the ETG buffered branch. Median crossing position x_cross = r_{u=1}/rout = 0.496 (IQR 0.32–0.62) vs the ETG buffered set where x_cross ranges 0.78–0.96. Near-threshold clinging (x_cross > 0.75) occurs in only 10–11 LTGs, vs all six ETG buffered cases.
The leading boundary-approach signal in the LTG buffered population is outer gas fraction: Pearson(f_gas,out, δu) = +0.416, Pearson(f_gas,out, x_cross) = −0.377 (both verified from raw files, n=77). Gas-richer buffered LTGs sit farther from the threshold and cross earlier. The inner completion variable Δ provides an independent secondary signal: the best tested compact organiser of LTG buffered boundary approach is f_gas,out − 0.869 Δ (LOO = 0.150, permutation p = 0.008, α stable across LOO folds: range 0.724–1.071, std = 0.047). This scalar is structurally distinct from the ETG K result: outer gas fraction replaces outer bulge fraction as the primary driver, and the coefficient is confirmed from raw files. Near-threshold buffered LTGs (x_cross > 0.75) have lower median outer gas fraction (0.057) than the rest (0.082). Note: two galaxies (UGC03580, x_cross = 0.008; UGC11820, x_cross = 0.076) have spurious inner crossings and should be excluded from functional residual analysis of the LTG buffered branch (clean sample: N=75).
No comparable signal from Rb, Rd, or outer disk surface brightness alone in the full LTG buffered sample.
12.2  LTG H+ candidates (new in v9)
Applying the ETG inner feasibility screen to buffered LTGs with non-negligible bulge fractions (Rb > 0.001, n=21 after spurious-crossing exclusion) and valid inner variables (h ≥ R_innermost), two galaxies pass all three inner feasibility conditions simultaneously: S < 1.70, Ω_in > 1, and Umax ≥ U* = 0.202.
NGC2841: Rb = 0.025, S = 0.597, Umax = 0.257, Ω_in = 17.6, u_out = 0.876. h = 3.651 kpc, R_innermost = 3.440 kpc (inner data valid). All conditions satisfied.
NGC4157: Rb = 0.006, S = 0.470, Umax = 0.309, Ω_in = 8.77, u_out = 0.622. h = 2.345 kpc, R_innermost = 1.740 kpc (inner data valid). All conditions satisfied.
These are the first LTG candidates passing the inner feasibility screen. Note: the inner variables are computed using the full baryonic Vbar2 (including gas) for the inner profile, and the outer load u(r) uses the disk+bulge-only convention. Full verification against the ETG four-condition gate (including outer classification consistency) is required before these can be treated as confirmed H+ candidates (Priority D).
13.  H+ Branch Mathematics
13.1  Sign gate and suppression structure
For H+ galaxies (Ωin > 1), the suppression integral Gsupp must be computed via the integration-by-parts (IBP) form:
Gsupp = V̅²har(rin) · κ*,   κ* = 1 − (1/xB) ∫₀¹ exp(−(1−y)/xB) B(y) dy
where B(y) = V̅²har(rin y)/V̅²har(rin) and xB = LB/rin. The exact algebraic decomposition:
κ* = exp(−1/xB) + U,   U = (1/xB) ∫₀¹ exp(−(1−y)/xB)[1 − B(y)] dy
13.2  The J-branch and amplitude cancellation
Defining Δ = 1 − Q12, H(y) = (1 − B(y))/Δ, and substituting xB = AΔ:
U = J(A)/A,   J(A) = ∫₀¹ exp(−(1−y)/(AΔ)) H(y) dy
The substitution xB ∝ Δ is the unique scaling that removes the explicit deficit amplitude from the U prefactor, reducing U to a kernel-weighted integral of the normalised profile shape H(y).
13.3  Branch invariants (verified from raw files)

Galaxy	rin	Q12	Q14	Ωin	u	Umax	xloc
NGC2685	0.310	0.5448	0.1944	1.1231	0.4981	0.272	1.5478
NGC3626	0.370	0.6179	0.2040	1.3160	0.7334	0.243	1.3026
NGC3941	0.270	0.6858	0.2606	1.2246	0.7738	0.216	1.0128
NGC4203	0.460	0.9384	0.6208	1.2757	1.3374	0.107	n/a

Single-channel calibrators: U* = 0.201803 (mean; CV = 0.00% by construction), Aloc = 3.344 (CV = 2.56%). Branch law: xB ≈ 3.34(1 − Q12), LB ≈ 3.34 rin(1 − Q12).
13.4  Feasibility conditions
Two simultaneous conditions required for single-channel viability: (1) Outer capacity: u ≤ 1. (2) Inner kernel capacity: U* ≤ Umax(B). NGC4203 violates BOTH independently: u = 1.337 > 1 and Umax = 0.107 < 0.202. Its failure is structural, not borderline.
13.5  Canonical pipeline
For any single-channel H+ galaxy: find xloc = high root of U(xB; B) = U* = 0.201803, then set LB = xloc × rin. No global disk fitting, no external h, no dependence on disk decomposition conventions.
14.  S-law Across LTGs and ETGs (new in v8)
The S → Umax law confirmed for LTGs (N=141, admissibility rule: h/r_out ≤ 0.3168, h ≥ R_innermost, Δ > 0; verified from raw files):
Umax ≈ 0.2393 − 0.0718 ln(S),   R² = 0.923
The threshold S < 1.70 ⇔ inner-feasible applies at 135/141 (95.7%) of LTGs. High-S LTGs (S ≥ 1.70): 16 LTGs, all 16 infeasible (16/16). The law is structurally the same as the ETG version; the ETG result is not a special-case artefact.
Population medians (verified from raw files):

Statistic	ETG (n=16)	LTG (n=141)
median Q12	0.637	0.514
median Q14	0.235	0.254
median Δ = 1−Q12	0.363	0.486
median S	0.694	0.517
frac(Δ < 0.2)	0.188	0.078
frac(S > 1.7)	0.250	0.113

ETGs are shifted toward smaller Δ (higher Q12), not toward larger Q14. The ETG/LTG difference is primarily a population-position effect in the (Δ, Q14) plane, not a different law. ETGs are ∼2.2× more likely than LTGs to have S > 1.7.
15.  Falsification Controls
15.1  Sign gate isolation: NGC3838 vs NGC3626
Both galaxies are in the viable profile locus, both are outer-feasible, both are inner-feasible. H(0.3) = 1.8664 vs 1.8668 — near-identical normalised deficit shapes. The split is entirely due to absolute inner baryonic amplitude: V̅har(rin) = 194 km/s (Ωin = 0.705) vs 284 km/s (Ωin = 1.316).
15.2  Outer demand isolation: NGC4203 vs NGC3626
Both H+ (Ωin > 1). NGC4203 has collapsed Δ = 0.062 (vs 0.382), Q14 = 0.621 (vs 0.204), S = 10.07 (vs 0.534), back-half overshoot, and u = 1.337 > 1. It is not the same class with bigger u; it is a different structural regime.
15.3  Disk-buffered outer isolation: NGC3941 vs UGC6176
Xout = 2.308 vs 2.240 (nearly identical). fbul = 0.086 vs 0.086 (identical). fdisk = 0.318 vs 0.222. The outer disk term is the sole separator. Confirmed: the outer disk log-slope −0.500 is a shared property of all six buffered ETGs at their outer edges.

Empirical (verified from raw files)
q ≈ 0.77 global; Rmax = 1.758948; C = 0.459411; U* = 0.201803 (CV = 0.00% by construction); Aloc = 3.344 (CV = 2.56%, 3-galaxy calibration); Stage-4 exponents a ≈ 0.78, b ≈ 1.61 (full sample); buffered profile collapse coefficients u(x) ≈ 1 − 1.588(x−1) + 1.392(x−1)² on shared window [0.92, 1.04]; outer bulge Keplerian tail log-slope = −0.500 for all buffered ETGs; ETG residual mode organiser Z = log(Rb/δu) + 0.30 S (LOO = 0.0017); LTG buffered boundary law f_gas,out − 0.869 Δ (LOO = 0.150, permutation p = 0.008); Pearson(f_gas,out, δu) = +0.416 for buffered LTGs.
Not locked / open
Stage-4 exponents not yet derived from first principles. ETG residual mode coefficient α ≈ 0.30 in Z = log(Rb/δu) + αS is stable across robustness tests but anchored by NGC3941 (n=6); not lock-grade as a coefficient law. LTG H+ candidates NGC2841 and NGC4157 pass inner feasibility screen but require full ETG gate verification.

19.  Conclusion
The MTS framework yields a transport-response law for disk galaxies with cosmological normalisation, photometric scale closure, zero-parameter memory correction, and emergent response branching. LTGs follow a closed first-order law (median RMSE 20.60 km/s, zero free parameters). ETGs form a multi-family, multi-sign response sector with a layered structure.
The ETG sector is governed by a four-condition intersection: profile family, sign gate, inner feasibility (S ≲ 1.70, 15/16 correct), and outer capacity (u ≤ 1). The outer gate factorises exactly into a load coordinate Xout and a disk-carried cancellation coordinate Rd. The viability boundary Xout < Rmax/(1 − Rd) classifies all 16 ETGs correctly.
New results in v8/v9: (1) The exact outer control variable δu = 1 − u = (Xcrit − Xout)/Xcrit is confirmed for all 16 ETGs. (2) Buffered outer-viable ETGs share a common rescaled radial approach profile near u = 1, with a one-mode residual structure organised by Z = log(Rb/δu) + 0.30 S (LOO = 0.0017, verified). (3) The joint (S, u_out) plane maps 175 SPARC galaxies and confirms the ETG-exclusive empty quadrant S ≥ 1.7, u_out < 1. (4) LTGs show the same low-load / buffered outer route split (81/77), with boundary approach organised by f_gas,out − 0.869 Δ (permutation p = 0.008). (5) The S → Umax law is confirmed in LTGs (R² = 0.923, N=141), establishing it as a general cross-type result. (6) The LTG inner admissibility rule is confirmed as h/r_out ≤ 0.3168 (Priority J closed). (7) Two LTG H+ candidates identified: NGC2841 (S = 0.597, Umax = 0.257, Ω_in = 17.6, u_out = 0.876) and NGC4157 (S = 0.470, Umax = 0.309, Ω_in = 8.77, u_out = 0.622), both satisfying all three inner feasibility conditions with valid inner data.
20.  Methods and Data
Data: SPARC ROTMOD files (Lelli et al. 2016, 175 galaxies). ETG rotation curves from ATLAS3D (16 galaxies). ETG photometric decompositions: Laurikainen et al. 2011, MNRAS 418:1452 (NIRS0S atlas). High-resolution bulge/disk component profiles used for all inner-branch and outer-chain computations.
Baryonic convention: V̅²har = V²gas + 0.5 V²disk + 0.7 V²bul; M/Ldisk = 0.5, M/Lbul = 0.7.
File conventions: ROTMOD files: comments='#'. Bulge/disk component files: comments='!'. G_supp must use the IBP form; derivative-based form underestimates 10–15% on coarse grids.
Canonical rin values: NGC2685 = 0.310, NGC3626 = 0.370, NGC3941 = 0.270, NGC4203 = 0.460 kpc (locked). All other ETGs use first rotmod row.
Framework constants: Γ0 = 809.956 km²/s²/kpc; Rmax = 1.758948; C = 0.459411; U* = 0.201803; p = 0.03.
Evaluation: RMSE = √(mean[(Vmodel − Vobs)²]).
All tables: verified from raw ETG and LTG files. No numbers are taken from fitted models without raw-file confirmation. Numbers marked [UNVERIFIED] or flagged in the open-items list should not be cited without further checking.
