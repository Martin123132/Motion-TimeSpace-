ABSTRACT
--------

Previous work within the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework has independently
derived (i) the charged-lepton family structure from angular curvature–memory
geometry and (ii) the full neutrino oscillation sector from a geometric
curvature-exchange Hamiltonian. In this paper we unify these results into a
single particle-scale picture.

We show that the qualitative differences between charged leptons and neutrinos
arise from a single geometric distinction: charged leptons correspond to
non-zero angular winding modes of the ψ field, while neutrinos correspond to
effectively zero-winding (radial) modes. Angular winding stores curvature
density and incurs a steep curvature–memory cost, enforcing finite family
number, suppressing flavour mixing, and producing large masses. In contrast,
zero-winding modes carry negligible angular curvature, allowing small masses
and efficient Γ-mediated inter-channel exchange.

This explains, within one framework, why neutrinos are neutral, extremely
light, and strongly mixing, while charged leptons are massive, non-mixing, and
family-limited. No additional symmetries, charges, or Yukawa couplings are
introduced.


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

The Standard Model treats charged leptons and neutrinos as fundamentally
distinct entities. Charged leptons possess electric charge, large mass
hierarchies, and no observable flavour mixing, while neutrinos are neutral,
extremely light, and undergo large-angle oscillations.

Although both sectors are experimentally well described, the Standard Model
offers no geometric or dynamical explanation for these qualitative differences.
Instead, the distinction is imposed through separate Yukawa structures and
assumed quantum numbers.

In contrast, the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework describes all matter as
persistent configurations of a single nonlinear motion field ψ interacting
with an irreversible curvature–memory field Γ. In this context, qualitative
particle properties must arise from geometry rather than imposed labels.

This paper demonstrates that the observed differences between charged leptons
and neutrinos follow directly from whether a ψ-configuration carries angular
winding.


2. SUMMARY OF CHARGED-LEPTON RESULTS
-----------------------------------

Recent analysis within MTS has shown that charged leptons correspond to angular
phase winding modes of a fixed-radius ψ soliton:

ψₙ(r,θ) = ψ_soliton(r) · exp(i n θ)

Key results established previously are:

• Radial solitons possess a fixed spatial extent independent of internal energy.
• Angular winding incurs a curvature–memory cost scaling approximately as n³–n⁴.
• The normalized curvature cost Ξ(n) = C(n)/C(1) grows rapidly for n > 5.
• Curvature–memory saturation suppresses higher angular modes, enforcing a
  finite family number.
• Curvature cost depends only on |n|, yielding exact charge–anticharge symmetry.
• Increasing angular winding increases internal curvature density without
  increasing spatial size.

Among viable modes n = 1, 2, 3, curvature density increases monotonically,
naturally identifying the electron, muon, and tau families.

These results establish charged leptons as angularly structured ψ
configurations whose mass hierarchy and family number arise from curvature
geometry.


3. SUMMARY OF NEUTRINO OSCILLATION RESULTS
-----------------------------------------

Separately, the neutrino sector has been derived within MTS as a three-channel
curvature-memory system governed by a Hermitian Hamiltonian:

H = Ψ + Γκ

where:

• Ψ_ij is a symmetric curvature-exchange tensor,
• Γκ_ij is an antisymmetric torsion / curvature-flow tensor,
• κ_i are channel-resolved curvature intensities.

Diagonalization of H reproduces:

• the PMNS mixing matrix,
• observed mixing angles,
• the CP-violating phase,
• correct neutrino mass-squared differences.

All mixing and CP violation arise geometrically from curvature memory and
torsion. No Yukawa matrices or arbitrary rotations are introduced.

What remained unclear in that work was why neutrinos exhibit such different
qualitative behavior from charged leptons within the same ψ–Γ framework.


4. ANGULAR WINDING AS THE DISTINGUISHING GEOMETRY
-------------------------------------------------

The results above can be unified by recognizing a single geometric distinction:

Charged leptons carry non-zero angular winding.
Neutrinos correspond to effectively zero-winding modes.

In MTS terms:

• Angular winding stores curvature density locally.
• Curvature density sources Γ and incurs an energetic penalty.
• Zero-winding configurations avoid angular curvature entirely.

Thus, neutrinos are naturally described by ψ configurations with:

n ≈ 0

rather than by introducing a separate particle ontology.


5. WHY NEUTRINOS ARE NEUTRAL
---------------------------

Electric charge in MTS arises from angular phase winding orientation:

+ charge → exp(+i n θ)
− charge → exp(−i n θ)

Zero-winding modes possess no angular phase orientation and therefore no charge.
Charge neutrality of neutrinos is thus a direct geometric consequence of
n ≈ 0, not an imposed quantum number.


6. WHY NEUTRINOS ARE LIGHT
-------------------------

Curvature density for angular modes scales steeply with n. In contrast,
zero-winding modes carry only radial curvature, which is energetically cheap.

As a result:

• Charged leptons store large curvature density → large mass.
• Neutrinos store minimal curvature density → small mass.

The small effective neutrino curvature amplitude Φ_ν introduced in earlier
work is therefore not ad hoc, but reflects the natural suppression of curvature
memory in zero-winding configurations embedded in the background Γ_G structure.


7. WHY NEUTRINOS MIX
-------------------

Angular winding strongly suppresses curvature exchange between modes due to the
high curvature–memory cost of angular mismatch. This suppresses flavour mixing
in the charged-lepton sector.

In contrast, zero-winding modes do not incur angular curvature penalties.
Curvature exchange between neutrino channels is therefore inexpensive, allowing
Γ-mediated coupling to generate large-angle mixing.

Thus:

• Charged leptons do not mix because angular curvature penalties suppress
  channel exchange.
• Neutrinos mix because curvature exchange is energetically allowed.


8. WHY CHARGED LEPTONS DO NOT MIX
--------------------------------

Any attempt to mix charged-lepton angular modes would require transporting
angular curvature between channels. This incurs a curvature–memory cost that
rapidly exceeds Γ saturation limits.

Consequently, charged-lepton flavour eigenstates are dynamically stable and
non-mixing, while neutrino flavour eigenstates are not.


9. UNIFIED PARTICLE-SCALE PICTURE
---------------------------------

Within Motion–TimeSpace, the particle spectrum is organized geometrically:

• Radial soliton → particle size (fixed)
• Angular winding n → charge and family identity
• Curvature density → mass capacity
• Γ-mediated exchange → mixing behavior

Charged leptons and neutrinos differ not by symmetry assignment but by angular
structure.


10. CONCLUSION
--------------

The qualitative differences between charged leptons and neutrinos emerge
naturally within Motion–TimeSpace from a single geometric principle: the
presence or absence of angular phase winding in the ψ field.

Angular winding produces charge, large curvature density, finite family number,
and suppressed mixing. Zero-winding configurations remain neutral, light, and
strongly mixing. No additional particle ontology, symmetries, or couplings are
required.

This unifies the charged-lepton family structure and neutrino oscillation
phenomenology within a single curvature–memory framework.
