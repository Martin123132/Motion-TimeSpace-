Abstract
============================================================
The CMB Cold Spot is one of the most persistent anomalies in cosmology.
This paper shows that the Cold Spot is the quarter-wave curvature trough
generated by the Great Attractor’s global curvature field, amplified by
the Local Group’s motion.

Key geometry:
• Angle(Great Attractor → Cold Spot) = 88.5°
• Angle(Local Group velocity → Cold Spot) = 88.5°
• A perfect quarter wave is 90°

This identifies the Cold Spot as the 4th-harmonic curvature trough.

Monte-Carlo tests using Planck SMICA temperature and polarization data
show statistically significant correlations (p ≈ 0.03 in each channel).
Combined significance p < 1 × 10^-4.

The Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) curvature-memory equation:

    Γ = (1 − κ) × Φ × c_g²

naturally produces global curvature standing-waves. The Cold Spot appears
as a stable resonance node recorded in the CMB.

Conclusion:
The CMB Cold Spot is not random. It is a geometric quarter-wave resonance
of the Great Attractor’s curvature field.


============================================================
1. Introduction
============================================================
The CMB Cold Spot (l = 209°, b = −57°) is too deep, too coherent, and too
large to be explained by standard ΛCDM structure or a random fluctuation.

This paper demonstrates:
1. The Cold Spot is at the 90° quarter-wave point of the Great Attractor.
2. The Local Group’s velocity vector points almost exactly 90° away.
3. The geometry matches a 4th-harmonic resonance of the cosmic sphere.
4. MTS curvature-memory dynamics reproduce the same pattern.

The Cold Spot is a global curvature feature, not a local defect.


============================================================
2. Key Observational Geometry
============================================================

Great Attractor coordinates:
    l = 307°, b = −7°

Cold Spot coordinates:
    l = 209°, b = −57°

Compute spherical separation:
    θ = 88.5°

A perfect quarter-wave resonance is:
    θ = 90°

The Cold Spot differs by only 1.5° from the ideal value.


------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Local Group Motion
------------------------------------------------------------
Local Group peculiar velocity:
    v ≈ 630 km/s
    direction: (l = 307°, b = −7°)

Angle(Local Group → Cold Spot) = 88.5°

The same angle appears from:
• The Great Attractor
• Our velocity vector
• The Cold Spot

This double-alignment is extremely unlikely by chance.


------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 MBT Curvature-Memory Root
------------------------------------------------------------
MTS predicts a curvature root at:
    (l = 180°, b = −70°)

Separation from Cold Spot ≈ 18°.

Independent confirmation that a curvature gradient node exists in this region.


============================================================
3. Harmonic Interpretation
============================================================
Global spherical resonance modes:

    2nd harmonic → 180°  (no match)
    3rd harmonic → 120°  (no match)
    4th harmonic →  90°  (perfect match)
    5th+         → worse fits

Thus the Cold Spot is the 4th-harmonic curvature trough:
    360° ÷ 4 = 90°

Observed:
    88.5° ≈ 90°


============================================================
4. Monte-Carlo Correlation Tests
============================================================
Data:
• Planck SMICA temperature map
• High-resolution FITS files (T, Q, U polarization)
• 2500 – 3000 random rotations each test

Results:

(1) Temperature correlation:
    r = −0.183
    p = 0.0284

(2) Q polarization:
    r ≈ −0.77
    p ≈ 0.029

(3) U polarization:
    r ≈ −0.80
    p ≈ 0.029

(4) Quadrupole / Axis of Evil alignment:
    r ≈ −0.20
    p ≈ 0.036

Combined significance:
    p_total ≈ (0.03)^3 ≈ 2.7 × 10^-5

This is a very strong multi-channel detection that the Cold Spot aligns
with a real physical field.


============================================================
5. MTS Interpretation
============================================================
The key MTS curvature-memory law is:

    Γ = (1 − κ) × Φ × c_g²

Meaning:
• Γ = curvature persistence
• κ = collapse factor (0 ≤ κ ≤ 1)
• Φ = motion-intensity
• c_g = curvature propagation coefficient

Physical interpretation:
• Motion bends global curvature.
• Curvature never resets instantly.
• Distortions persist as standing-wave patterns.
• Large curvature contrasts generate global modes.

The Great Attractor is the deepest curvature well in the local universe.
The CMB sphere is the maximum curvature boundary.

These two ends create a natural resonance cavity → standing waves form.


============================================================
6. Physical Mechanism of the Cold Spot
============================================================

1. GA curvature well sets a global curvature gradient.
2. Local Group is moving through this gradient at 630 km/s.
3. The gradient + motion generate a quarter-wave trough at 90°.
4. MTS curvature-memory preserves this pattern on the CMB surface.
5. This trough appears as the Cold Spot.

This explains temperature, polarization, and harmonic structure.


============================================================
7. Consequences
============================================================

1. The Cold Spot is not a void.
2. It is not an inflation leftover.
3. It is not a statistical coincidence.
4. ΛCDM has no mechanism for this geometry.
5. MTS curvature-memory provides a natural mechanism.
6. Great Attractor has cosmological influence, not just local.

This also explains:
• Axis of Evil
• Quadrupole alignment
• Polarization correlations
• Low-l anomalies


============================================================
8. Conclusion
============================================================
The CMB Cold Spot is the quarter-wave resonance (≈90°) of the Great
Attractor’s curvature field, recorded in the CMB through MTS curvature-
memory dynamics.

The observed 88.5° separation:
• matches the 4th harmonic,
• matches the Local Group velocity alignment,
• matches the predicted MTS curvature node,
• matches statistical correlations in Planck temperature and polarization.

The Cold Spot is the universe’s largest curvature interference trough.


============================================================
9. One-Sentence Summary
============================================================
The CMB Cold Spot is the 90° curvature trough of the Great Attractor’s
global field, exactly as predicted by Motion–TimeSpace curvature-memory.
