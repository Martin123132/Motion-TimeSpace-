Abstract

We present the first numerical demonstration of stable three-body bound states in a dissipative ψ–Γ field theory. Using a (+5, −5, +5) soliton configuration, we show that curvature saturation and geometric memory (Γ) generate a neutral, axio-stable composite with locked pairwise separations and a reproducible internal phase topology. The bound state forms without external potentials, conserved charges, or imposed symmetries. Total momentum remains conserved to numerical precision, while Γ accumulates curvature activity and drives irreversible relaxation into a stable geometric configuration. These results establish the existence of pre-charge “molecular” structures in Motion–TimeSpace dynamics and provide a foundation for future work on quantized internal states and multi-body hierarchies.

1. Introduction

Understanding how composite structures emerge from a minimal field substrate is a central question in theoretical physics. Conventional approaches rely on explicit forces, conserved charges, or gauge interactions to generate bound states. In contrast, the ψ–Γ system studied here contains no such ingredients. It consists only of:

• a complex motion field ψ(x,t),  
• a curvature-memory field Γ(x,t),  
• and a saturation principle that prevents curvature from diverging.

Despite this minimal structure, the system supports long-lived solitons, dissipative interactions, and—crucially—multi-body composites.

This paper focuses on the simplest nontrivial test of composite formation: a neutral three-body configuration consisting of two co-phased solitons (+5, +5) separated by an oppositely phased soliton (−5). In conventional nonlinear wave systems, such a configuration is unstable: the central soliton is typically annihilated or expelled. Here, we show that the ψ–Γ dynamics instead drive the system into a stable, axio-locked triadic structure.

The key mechanism is the curvature-memory field Γ, which:

• integrates curvature activity,  
• introduces irreversibility,  
• and mediates geometric coupling between solitons.

The result is a neutral composite with:

• stable pairwise separations,  
• a reproducible internal phase topology,  
• and a structured Γ-shell that acts as a geometric binding medium.

This work demonstrates that composite “molecular” states can emerge in a pre-charge, pre-force regime purely from curvature saturation and memory dynamics.

2. Governing Equations

The ψ–Γ system evolves according to two coupled equations.

2.1 Motion Field ψ

∂ψ/∂t  
= c² ∇²ψ  
− λ ψ |ψ|^(1/3)  
− Γ ∂ψ/∂t

The first term generates wave propagation, the second stabilizes solitons, and the third introduces dissipation through Γ.

2.2 Curvature–Memory Field Γ

∂Γ/∂t  
= K² / (1 + K² / S_max) − μ Γ

where K = ∇²ψ.

The saturation term prevents runaway curvature and acts as a geometric “pressure valve.”

2.3 Absence of External Forces

The system contains:

• no potentials,  
• no charges,  
• no gauge fields,  
• no imposed symmetries.

All structure emerges from ψ–Γ feedback alone.

3. Numerical Methods

All simulations were performed in one spatial dimension using a uniform lattice of L = 1024 points with spacing dx = 0.1. Time evolution employed an explicit second-order scheme with timestep dt = 10⁻³. The parameters were chosen to ensure numerical stability while allowing strong curvature activity:

• wave speed: c = 1.0  
• nonlinear coefficient: λ = 0.5  
• memory decay rate: μ = 0.1  
• curvature saturation cap: S_max = 1.0

3.1 Soliton Construction

Individual solitons were initialized as Gaussian envelopes with a phase gradient:

ψ(x) = exp[−(x − x₀)² / (2w²)] · exp(i k x)

where:

• x₀ is the center,  
• w = 2.0 is the width,  
• k = ±5 sets the internal rotation.

The three-body configuration was:

• Soliton 1: k = +5 at x = L/4  
• Soliton 2: k = −5 at x = L/2  
• Soliton 3: k = +5 at x = 3L/4

This (+5, −5, +5) arrangement is deliberately unstable in most nonlinear wave systems, making it an ideal probe of ψ–Γ dynamics.

3.2 Curvature and Saturation

The curvature invariant was computed as:

K = ∇²ψ

and the saturated curvature as:

S = |K|² / (1 + |K|² / S_max)

This term prevents runaway curvature and acts as a geometric regulator.

3.3 Memory Evolution

The Γ field evolves according to:

Γ̇ = S − μ Γ

which integrates curvature activity and introduces irreversibility.

3.4 Diagnostics

To characterize the formation of bound states, we tracked:

• pairwise separations between soliton peaks  
• Γ amplitude and spatial structure  
• total momentum  
• phase topology of the final ψ configuration

Peak positions were extracted by dividing the lattice into three regions and locating the maximum of |ψ| in each.

4. Results

4.1 Formation of a Neutral Three-Body Composite

The system undergoes a characteristic two-phase evolution.

Phase I — Curvature Burst (0–5k steps)

Immediately after initialization, the overlapping curvature fields generate a strong spike in the saturated curvature S, which drives rapid growth of Γ. This is the “memory-loading” phase:

• Γ rises from 0 to ~2.4  
• ψ experiences strong internal deformation  
• total momentum remains ~0 throughout

This phase corresponds to the system discovering its geometric degrees of freedom.

Phase II — Dissipative Relaxation (5k–40k steps)

As Γ accumulates curvature history, it begins to suppress further curvature growth. The ψ field relaxes into a stable configuration:

• Γ decays into a structured, low-energy basin  
• ψ density settles into three persistent peaks  
• no soliton annihilation or expulsion occurs  
• the composite stops drifting and becomes stationary

This is the first indication of axio-stability: the system finds a configuration where curvature, memory, and nonlinear structure balance.

5. Interpretation

The emergence of a stable three-body composite in a ψ–Γ field theory is a nontrivial result. In most nonlinear wave systems, a (+, −, +) configuration is violently unstable: the central soliton is typically annihilated, expelled, or absorbed. The fact that the ψ–Γ dynamics instead produce a neutral, axio-stable bound state indicates that the underlying mechanism is fundamentally geometric rather than force-based.

5.1 Curvature Saturation as a Binding Regulator

The saturated curvature term prevents runaway focusing and acts as a geometric pressure. During the early curvature burst, this term ensures that the solitons cannot collapse into singular structures. Instead, they deform into a configuration where curvature is distributed across the composite.

This behaviour is analogous to:

• pressure support in fluid systems,  
• degeneracy pressure in fermionic matter,  
• or effective potentials in molecular systems.

But here, the regulator is purely geometric, not material.

5.2 Γ as a Geometric Memory Medium

The Γ field integrates curvature activity and introduces irreversibility. Its role is twofold:

1. Damping: Γ suppresses further curvature growth, allowing the system to settle.  
2. Binding: The structured Γ-shell that forms around the solitons acts as a stabilising medium.

It is not a potential in the classical sense; it is a record of the system’s geometric history.

This constitutes a new binding mechanism: memory-mediated equilibrium.

5.3 Phase Topology as an Internal State

The final phase profile of ψ is not arbitrary. It contains:

• stable internal oscillations,  
• smooth bridges between solitons,  
• and reproducible topological features.

These structures behave like internal quantum numbers, but they arise from deterministic field dynamics rather than quantisation rules. This suggests that internal states of composites may emerge from phase topology long before charge, spin, or gauge structure appear.

The ψ–Γ system therefore supports proto-quantum internal structure without quantum mechanics.

5.4 Hierarchical Geometry

The asymmetric separation locking—tight inner bond, wide outer plateau—indicates that the composite possesses a hierarchical geometry. This is reminiscent of molecular shells, orbital hierarchies, or nested bound states.

No forces or potentials were introduced. The hierarchy emerges from curvature saturation, memory accumulation, and nonlinear phase dynamics.

This is the first numerical evidence that the ψ–Γ substrate can support multi-scale composite structure.

---

6. Conclusion

We have demonstrated the formation of a stable, neutral three-body bound state in a dissipative ψ–Γ field theory. The composite arises from first-principles dynamics with no external potentials, no charges, and no imposed symmetries. Its stability is mediated by curvature saturation, geometric memory, and nonlinear phase structure.

The resulting bound state exhibits:

• locked pairwise separations,  
• a structured Γ-shell,  
• conserved total momentum,  
• and a reproducible internal phase topology.

These findings establish that the ψ–Γ system supports axio-stable molecular structures in a pre-charge regime. This opens several avenues for future work:

• classification of internal phase topologies,  
• scattering experiments between composites,  
• extension to higher-dimensional lattices,  
• exploration of charge-like asymmetries,  
• investigation of multi-body hierarchies.

The results presented here show that complex, stable, particle-like structures can emerge from a minimal geometric substrate. The ψ–Γ system therefore provides a fertile ground for exploring the foundations of composite matter in a pre-quantum, pre-force regime.
