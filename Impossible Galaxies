\subsection{JWST ``Impossible Galaxies'' as Curvature--Drift Equilibria}

Recent JWST observations have revealed massive, morphologically mature disk galaxies at
redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$, only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang in the
$\Lambda$CDM clock. In the standard picture, structure formation is limited by gradual,
bottom--up hierarchical merging of dark--matter halos, so such systems appear
``impossible'': they are too massive, too ordered, and seemingly assembled too quickly.

Within the MBT--5 Motion--TimeSpace (MTS) framework, these objects are not anomalous.
They are the natural expression of curvature drift in a high--$\Gamma_G$ epoch.

\subsubsection{1. The ``Age'' Illusion from a Curvature--Dependent Clock}

In $\Lambda$CDM the mapping between redshift and cosmic time is fixed by a chosen
expansion history. In MTS, the extended Einstein equation
\begin{equation}
  G_{\mu\nu} + \Gamma_G(z)\,g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
contains a dynamical Global Curvature Gradient $\Gamma_G(z)$, empirically fitted as
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_G(z)
    = \bigl(\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \log(1+z)\bigr)\,\log(1+z) + \beta z,
\end{equation}
from supernovae, BAO, and CMB distance data.\footnote{See the MBT--5 cosmology and EFT
papers for the full fit and parameter values.}
This same scalar enters the thermodynamic clock factor
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \Gamma_G},
\end{equation}
so that ``proper'' geometric time $\tau$ and the coordinate time $t$ used in
$\Lambda$CDM do not coincide in high--curvature regimes.

At $z \gtrsim 10$, $\Gamma_G$ is significantly larger than today, and the effective
conversion between redshift and elapsed geometric time is stretched. What appears as
$\sim 300$ Myr of evolution when inferred with a static--$\Lambda$ clock can correspond
to a substantially longer \emph{geometric epoch} in the MTS picture. The galaxies do not
need to assemble ``faster than gravity allows''; instead, the early universe simply has
a broader curvature--regulated time budget than $\Lambda$CDM assumes.

\subsubsection{2. Rapid Structural Stabilisation via $\psi$--Solitons}

The microscopic MTS dynamics are governed by the nonlinear motion field $\psi$ with
Planck--scale action
\begin{equation}
  A_{\mathrm{MTS}}[\psi]
    = \int \left[
        \frac{1}{2c^2}(\partial_t\psi)^2
        - \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\psi)^2
        - \frac{\gamma}{2}\,\psi\,\partial_t\psi
        - \frac{\lambda}{n}\,|\psi|^n
      \right] d^4x,
  \qquad n = \frac{4}{3}.
\end{equation}
The $|\psi|^{4/3}$ term generates stable, finite--energy solitons across scales; the same
mechanism that produces particle solitons (e.g.\ the proton) also admits extended
curvature solitons in a cosmological background.

In standard gravity, baryons must slowly collapse inside dark--matter halos, against
cosmic expansion, via many dynamical times. In MTS, high background curvature enhances
the effective nonlinearity of the $\psi$ field: in a large $\Gamma_G$ environment, the
field relaxes toward low--energy, high--coherence configurations more efficiently than
collision--driven halo merging. The observed galaxy mass profile exponent
$M(r)\propto r^{m}$ with $m \simeq 1.878$ is a geometric fixed point of virialised
disks, found empirically across mature spirals over many orders of magnitude in mass.
In MBT--5 this profile is not the outcome of billions of years of random mergers, but a
preferred equilibrium of the $\psi$--field tension.\footnote{See the
$\alpha \propto \sqrt{r}$ / $M(r)\propto r^{1.878}$ analysis for the full scaling
hierarchy.}

Thus in a high--$\Gamma_G$ epoch, extended, soliton--like disk structures can settle
into the $m\simeq1.88$ fixed point on an internal timescale set by the curvature--dependent
clock factor, rather than the naive $\Lambda$CDM lookback time.

\subsubsection{3. Mass--Luminosity Bias from Curvature--Driven $\alpha$ Drift}

JWST does not measure mass; it measures flux. The conversion from observed brightness
to an inferred stellar mass relies on stellar population models that assume:
(i) a fixed expansion history, and (ii) a fixed value of the fine--structure constant
$\alpha$. In the MTS framework, both assumptions are relaxed.

As shown in the MBT--5 ``varying $\alpha$'' derivation, the angular bandwidth
$\ell_{\max}$ of the curvature--memory field sets the effective resolution of the
electromagnetic sector. Because $\ell_{\max}$ is constrained by the local curvature
energy density, the same evolving $\Gamma_G(z)$ that regulates the clock also produces
a small, redshift--dependent drift in $\alpha$,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}
    \simeq \epsilon\,\Gamma_G(z),
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon$ fixed by the stiffness of the MTS vacuum. Even a shift at the level
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha \sim 10^{-6}$ at $z\sim 3$ is enough to perturb atomic energy
levels, opacities, and hence the integrated luminosity of young stellar populations.

From the $\Lambda$CDM perspective, a galaxy at $z\gtrsim 10$ then appears ``too
bright'' for the mass that should exist by that time, so the brightness is translated
into an ``impossibly'' large stellar mass. From the MTS perspective, part of that
brightness excess is a curvature--induced change in the electromagnetic coupling
constant, i.e.\ a calibration bias in the mass--to--light ratio. The underlying mass
profile can remain consistent with the geometric fixed point of the $\psi$ field, even
if a static--$\alpha$ analysis overestimates it.

\subsubsection{4. Comparison: $\Lambda$CDM vs.\ MBT--5}

A schematic comparison of expectations:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Feature & $\Lambda$CDM Expectation & JWST Observation & MBT--5 Interpretation \\
\hline
Morphology at $z\gtrsim 10$
  & Irregular, fragmentary proto--galaxies
  & Ordered disks and compact cores
  & Stable $\psi$--field solitons near $m\simeq1.88$ \\
Typical stellar mass
  & Strongly suppressed massive disks
  & Substantial stellar masses in some systems
  & Early, curvature--aided condensation \\
Assembly timescale
  & Limited by DM halo buildup
  & Appears too short in standard clock
  & Extended geometric epoch via $\Gamma_G(z)$ \\
Flux $\rightarrow$ mass conversion
  & Fixed $\alpha$, fixed M/L
  & ``Too bright for the age''
  & Curvature--driven $\alpha$ drift biases M/L \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In summary, the JWST ``impossible galaxy'' tension arises only if one assumes that
gravity, time, and the electromagnetic coupling are static and independent of global
curvature. In the MBT--5 framework, Curvature Drift provides a unified buffer: the
Global Curvature Gradient $\Gamma_G(z)$ simultaneously stretches the effective early
time budget, accelerates structural relaxation of the $\psi$ field into the observed
disk equilibrium, and slightly shifts the mass--luminosity calibration via a small,
but coherent, variation in $\alpha$. What appears as a crisis for $\Lambda$CDM thus
emerges as a direct observational test of the MTS curvature gradient.
