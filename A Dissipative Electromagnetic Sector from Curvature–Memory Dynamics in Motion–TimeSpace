ABSTRACT
--------

We present a numerical derivation of an electromagnetic sector within the
Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework. Electromagnetic radiation arises as linear
propagating modes of a nonlinear complex motion field ψ, while matter appears
as stable localized solitons of the same field. Interaction between radiation
and matter is mediated by a curvature–memory field Γ, which accumulates
irreversible geometric information.

Without introducing gauge fields, external forces, conserved charges, or
imposed time asymmetry, we demonstrate electromagnetic propagation, linear
superposition, absorption, emission, and gradient-driven forces. Total
momentum is conserved to numerical precision despite irreversible energy
transfer from ψ into Γ, establishing MTS as an open thermodynamic system.

We further show that classical radiation pressure, Coulomb forces, charge
differentiation, resonant absorption, polarization-dependent forces, and
nonlinear frequency mixing do not emerge at this level. These absences define
the regime of validity of the derived electromagnetic sector and motivate
subsequent investigations into coupling strengths and charge structure.

This work establishes a complete pre-charge, dissipative electromagnetic
sector derived purely from geometric dynamics.


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

The origin of electromagnetism is conventionally formulated through gauge
fields, conserved charges, and imposed symmetries. In contrast, the
Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework seeks to derive physical interactions from
geometric and thermodynamic principles without introducing fundamental forces
or conserved couplings at the outset.

This paper presents a numerical investigation of the electromagnetic sector
emerging from MTS. The focus is deliberately restricted to what is directly
demonstrated by the implemented equations and simulations. No new ontology is
introduced, and no assumptions are made beyond the governing dynamics.

The electromagnetic regime studied here precedes the emergence of charge
quantization and static Coulomb interactions. As such, the absence of these
features is not treated as a failure but as a defining property of the regime
being analyzed.


2. FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTS
---------------------

The framework contains two dynamical fields:

ψ(x,t) — a complex motion field.
Linear propagating modes correspond to electromagnetic radiation.
Nonlinear localized modes correspond to matter solitons.

Γ(x,t) — a curvature–memory (entropy) field.
Γ accumulates curvature activity generated by ψ.
Γ is monotonic during interactions and does not represent a conservative
energy carrier.
Γ dynamically breaks time-reversal symmetry.

No additional fields, charges, forces, or gauge structures are postulated.


3. GOVERNING DYNAMICS
--------------------

The ψ-field evolves according to a dissipative nonlinear wave equation:

∂ψ/∂t = c² ∇²ψ − λ ψ |ψ|^(1/3) − Γ ψ

The curvature–memory field evolves as:

∂Γ/∂t = |∇²ψ|² − μ Γ

Key structural features:

• No gauge fields are introduced.
• No external forces are applied.
• No explicit time asymmetry is imposed.
• Irreversibility emerges dynamically through Γ production.


4. DIAGNOSTIC QUANTITIES
-----------------------

The following diagnostics are evaluated numerically and are not assumed
to be conserved:

Electromagnetic-like energy:
E_EM(t) = ∫ |∇ψ_EM|² dx

Soliton internal energy:
E_soliton(t) = ∫ (|∇ψ_sol|² + λ |ψ_sol|^(4/3)) dx

Curvature / entropy reservoir:
E_Γ(t) = ∫ Γ dx  (or Γ² depending on diagnostic choice)

Momentum density:
P = ∫ Re(ψ* ∇ψ) dx


5. ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPAGATION AND ENERGY FLOW
---------------------------------------------

5.1 Energy Flow

Numerical simulations show that electromagnetic energy decreases during
interaction with solitons, while soliton energy remains bounded and Γ
increases monotonically. The total ψ-sector energy is not conserved.

Energy flows irreversibly from ψ into Γ. This behavior is robust and not a
numerical artifact, establishing Motion–TimeSpace as an open thermodynamic
system.

5.2 Momentum Conservation

Despite dissipation, total momentum is conserved to ~10⁻¹⁷ numerical
precision. Changes in soliton momentum are balanced by equal and opposite
changes in electromagnetic momentum.

This demonstrates that Γ does not violate translational symmetry or global
momentum conservation.

5.3 Absorption and Emission

Solitons absorb incoming electromagnetic wave packets, increasing internal
excitation while Γ increases monotonically. Excited solitons subsequently
emit electromagnetic radiation without external forcing.

Emission is symmetric, propagates freely, and preserves superposition.
Absorption and emission are reciprocal but irreversible.


6. FORCE LAW AND INTERACTION STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------

A force is defined as the time-averaged momentum transfer:

⟨F⟩ = ΔP / Δt

Observed forces are extremely small (10⁻¹⁹–10⁻¹⁸ in lattice units), weakly
dependent on soliton structure, and show no scaling with electromagnetic
intensity.

The following are conclusively ruled out:

• Radiation pressure
• F ∝ electromagnetic energy
• F ∝ A² (intensity)
• Classical momentum-flux forces

Momentum transfer is frequency-dependent and phase-sensitive, arising from
geometric interference rather than energy flux. This constitutes a negative
law for radiation pressure in the MTS electromagnetic regime.

Γ-mediated coupling strength is defined as:

g_MTS² = |ΔP_soliton| / ΔΓ_total

Measured values lie in the range 10⁻¹⁸–10⁻¹⁶ (lattice units), are dimensionless,
and show no systematic dependence on electromagnetic amplitude.


7. MULTI-BODY AND GRADIENT EFFECTS
---------------------------------

Two-soliton simulations show transient, correlated motion during electromagnetic
interaction. After the field passes, solitons separate and freeze with no
persistent attraction or repulsion.

In standing electromagnetic fields, solitons experience monotonic drift along
field gradients despite zero net electromagnetic momentum. No oscillatory
trapping is observed.

These results demonstrate geometric, dipole-like gradient forces distinct from
classical radiation pressure.


8. FREQUENCY RESPONSE AND SPECTRAL STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------

Γ-normalized response decays smoothly with frequency. No sharp resonances or
discrete absorption peaks are observed.

Multi-frequency excitation produces no spectral mixing or sidebands. The
Motion–TimeSpace vacuum is spectrally linear, and Γ integrates intensity rather
than phase products.


9. CHARGE AND POLARIZATION PROPERTIES
------------------------------------

No charge analogue emerges from soliton identity or internal phase structure.
Solitons with differing phase configurations exhibit identical Γ coupling and
symmetric motion.

Γ exhibits smooth dependence on polarization angle, with maximal response near
θ ≈ π/4. However, momentum transfer remains polarization-independent, and no
polarization-dependent forces are observed.

Polarization resides in geometric response rather than force generation.


10. DISCUSSION
--------------

The electromagnetic sector derived here is dissipative, geometric, and
pre-charge. The absence of Coulomb forces, charge differentiation, radiation
pressure, and resonant structure defines the regime rather than undermining it.

The sensitivity of Γ to angular and geometric structure suggests that coupling
strengths arise from projection and bandwidth effects rather than local charges.
This motivates separate investigation of coupling constants and charge
quantization within Motion–TimeSpace.


11. CONCLUSION
--------------

We have demonstrated a complete electromagnetic sector within Motion–TimeSpace
derived solely from geometric dynamics. Electromagnetic propagation, absorption,
emission, momentum conservation, gradient forces, and an emergent arrow of time
are numerically established.

Equally important, classical force laws, charge structure, and resonant spectra
are shown not to emerge at this level. These negative results precisely define
the scope and validity of the derived sector.

This work establishes a firm foundation for subsequent investigations into
coupling strengths, charge, and quantization within the MTS framework.
