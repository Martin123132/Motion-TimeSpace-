ABSTRACT
--------

The origin of the arrow of time remains unresolved in fundamental
physics. Microscopic dynamical laws are time-reversal symmetric, yet
macroscopic processes are irreversible. Standard explanations rely on
statistical arguments, special initial conditions, or coarse-graining,
none of which provide a physical mechanism.

We show that in the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework the arrow of time
arises inevitably from curvature–memory dynamics. A scalar field Γ,
generated by motion-field gradients, accumulates irreversibly during
physical interactions. This accumulation breaks time-reversal symmetry
without modifying the underlying equations of motion.

We demonstrate that quantum measurement, electromagnetic absorption,
thermodynamic dissipation, and cosmological evolution all generate
monotonic Γ growth. The arrow of time is therefore not imposed, emergent,
or statistical: it is a geometric invariant of Motion–TimeSpace.


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

The laws of classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics,
and general relativity are invariant under time reversal. Yet observed
reality is not. Processes such as decay, diffusion, radiation emission,
and measurement occur in only one temporal direction.

Traditional resolutions invoke:
• low-entropy initial conditions,
• probabilistic coarse-graining,
• subjective observer knowledge.

These explanations describe irreversibility but do not cause it.

Motion–TimeSpace provides a physical mechanism: curvature memory.


2. FUNDAMENTAL MTS DYNAMICS
--------------------------

Motion–TimeSpace is defined by two coupled fields:

ψ(x,t)   : complex motion field
Γ(x,t)   : curvature–memory (entropy) field

The governing equations are:

∂²ψ/∂t² − c²∇²ψ + λ ψ |ψ|^(n−1) − Γ(x,t) ∂ψ/∂t = 0

∂Γ/∂t = |∇²ψ|² − μ Γ

Properties:

• Γ ≥ 0 always
• Γ increases during interactions
• Γ decays only in the absence of motion
• No explicit time asymmetry is imposed

Irreversibility arises dynamically.


3. TIME-REVERSAL SYMMETRY AND ITS FAILURE
-----------------------------------------

The ψ-field equation alone is formally time-reversal symmetric under:

t → −t
ψ → ψ*
Γ → Γ   (unchanged)

However, Γ obeys a first-order evolution equation with a positive
production term:

|∇²ψ|² ≥ 0

Under time reversal, Γ would need to decrease while gradients remain
finite. This is dynamically forbidden.

Thus:

Time-reversal symmetry holds if and only if Γ = 0 everywhere.

All physical systems have Γ > 0.

Therefore, exact time reversal is unphysical.


4. QUANTUM MEASUREMENT AS THE SMALLEST ARROW
--------------------------------------------

Quantum measurement involves interaction between a system motion field
and a detector motion field.

During interaction:
• ψ gradients increase
• Γ accumulates locally
• Γ exceeds a saturation threshold Γ_c

At Γ ≥ Γ_c, the motion field undergoes irreversible geometric
bifurcation into a single stable configuration.

Measurement therefore:
• forces irreversibility
• selects outcomes
• creates time asymmetry

Quantum measurement is the smallest physical generator of the arrow of
time.


5. ELECTROMAGNETIC IRREVERSIBILITY
---------------------------------

In the MTS electromagnetic sector, linear propagating ψ modes interact
with solitonic matter.

Numerical results show:
• electromagnetic energy decreases
• soliton energy remains bounded
• Γ increases monotonically
• total momentum is conserved

Energy flows irreversibly from ψ into Γ.

Radiation absorption and emission are therefore time-asymmetric despite
symmetric field equations.

Electromagnetism generates an arrow of time through curvature memory.


6. THERMODYNAMIC ENTROPY AND Γ
------------------------------

Macroscopic thermodynamic processes involve large numbers of interacting
degrees of freedom.

In MTS:
• each interaction contributes to Γ
• Γ accumulates across scales
• coarse-graining is unnecessary

Entropy increase is identified with curvature-memory growth.

The second law of thermodynamics is therefore a geometric consequence,
not a statistical postulate.


7. COSMOLOGICAL TIME DIRECTION
------------------------------

At the largest scale, the universe contains persistent motion and
structure formation.

All cosmic processes:
• generate ψ gradients
• accumulate Γ
• bias temporal evolution

The arrow of time is global because Γ accumulation is global.

No special initial conditions are required beyond the existence of
motion.


8. WHY TIME NEVER RUNS BACKWARD
-------------------------------

Reversing time would require:
• Γ to decrease everywhere
• curvature memory to be erased
• irreversible interactions to be undone

This is dynamically impossible within Motion–TimeSpace.

Time does not flow backward because curvature remembers motion.


9. RELATION TO OTHER APPROACHES
-------------------------------

• Statistical mechanics explains entropy growth but not irreversibility.
• Quantum decoherence suppresses interference but does not select time.
• General relativity permits time-reversal symmetric solutions.

Motion–TimeSpace provides a single physical mechanism across all scales.


10. CONCLUSION
--------------

The arrow of time is not emergent, statistical, or subjective.

In Motion–TimeSpace:
• Motion generates curvature
• Curvature stores memory
• Memory accumulates irreversibly
• Time acquires direction

Quantum measurement, electromagnetic dissipation, thermodynamics, and
cosmology are unified under one principle:

Time points in the direction of increasing curvature memory.
