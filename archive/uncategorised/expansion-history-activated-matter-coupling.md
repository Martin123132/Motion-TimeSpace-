ABSTRACT
============================================================

We investigate a phenomenological cosmological framework in which the
effective contribution of the matter sector to the late-time expansion
history is modulated by an activation function derived from accumulated
cosmological expansion history.

The Friedmann background is modified through a multiplicative
activation factor g(z) applied to the matter density,

    H(z)^2 = H0^2 [ Ωm (1+z)^3 g(z) + (1 − Ωm) ].

Three closely related representations of the activation law are
considered:

1. empirical redshift activation  
2. expansion-history activation using u = ln(1+z)  
3. equality-tied activation linking the activation scale to the
   matter–Λ equality epoch.

The models are tested against the Pantheon+ SH0ES Type Ia supernova
sample, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, the
Gold-2017 growth-rate compilation, and a CMB acoustic-scale constraint.

A full joint inference over the parameter set

    {H0, Ωm, α, ν, rd}

yields the best-fit activation cosmology

    H0 ≈ 72.32 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹  
    Ωm ≈ 0.231  
    α  ≈ 0.482  
    ν  ≈ 0.886  
    rd ≈ 154.31 Mpc  

with total likelihood

    χ²_total ≈ 832.83.

The activation transition occurs at

    z_s ≈ 0.21,

following matter–Λ equality at

    z_eq ≈ 0.49.

The activation cosmology remains compatible with current growth-rate
measurements and can be rewritten as an effective dynamical
dark-energy sector with redshift-dependent equation of state determined
entirely by the activation function.

These results suggest that late-time cosmic expansion may be describable
as a delayed response to accumulated expansion history rather than as
the consequence of a strictly constant dark-energy component.

1. INTRODUCTION
============================================================

The standard ΛCDM cosmological model describes the late-time expansion
of the Universe through cold matter and a constant vacuum-energy
density.

Although ΛCDM provides an excellent phenomenological description of a
wide range of observations, the physical origin of the cosmological
constant remains uncertain.

In this work we investigate an alternative phenomenological framework
in which the effective gravitational contribution of the matter sector
is modulated by a delayed activation process governed by accumulated
expansion history.

The modified Friedmann equation is

    H(z)^2 = H0^2 [ Ωm (1+z)^3 g(z) + (1 − Ωm) ].

When

    g(z) = 1,

the model reduces to the standard ΛCDM background.

============================================================
2. ACTIVATION FRAMEWORK
============================================================

We consider a stretched-exponential activation law

    g(z) = 1 − exp[ −u(z)^ν ],

where ν is a shape parameter and u(z) is a dimensionless loading
variable describing accumulated expansion history.

------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Empirical redshift activation
------------------------------------------------------------

The phenomenological form

    g(z) = 1 − exp[ −( z / (z_s x0) )^ν ]

introduces an activation scale z_s.

------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Expansion-history activation
------------------------------------------------------------

A physically motivated loading variable is

    u(z) = ln(1+z) / u_s

giving

    g(z) = 1 − exp[ −( ln(1+z) / u_s )^ν ].

------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Equality-tied activation
------------------------------------------------------------

Matter–Λ equality satisfies

    Ωm (1+z_eq)^3 = 1 − Ωm.

This implies

    u_eq = (1/3) ln[(1 − Ωm)/Ωm].

The activation scale is parameterized as

    u_s = α u_eq.

============================================================
3. CONSTITUTIVE FORM OF THE ACTIVATION LAW
============================================================

Define the inactive fraction

    S(u) = 1 − g(u)

and introduce the hidden memory amplitude

    M(u) = −ln[1 − g(u)].

If the hidden load obeys

    M(u) = u^ν

then

    g(u) = 1 − exp(−u^ν).

Differentiating yields

    dg/du = ν u^(ν−1) (1 − g).

This is a first-order saturating activation equation.

The same functional form appears if activation thresholds follow a
Weibull survival distribution

    P(λ > u) = exp(−u^ν).

============================================================
4. OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS
============================================================

The analysis uses four late-time probes.

Pantheon+ SH0ES  
    1701 Type Ia supernovae providing distance moduli μ(z).

DESI DR1 BAO  
    measurements of DM/rd, DH/rd and DV/rd.

Gold-2017 growth  
    18 measurements of fσ8(z).

CMB acoustic-scale constraint  
    ℓ_A ≈ 301.47.

The combined likelihood is

    χ²_total = χ²_SN + χ²_BAO + χ²_growth + χ²_CMB.

============================================================
5. EXPANSION-HISTORY FITS
============================================================

Joint Pantheon+ and DESI analysis gives

    ΛCDM baseline          χ² ≈ 834.07  
    empirical activation   χ² ≈ 820.98  
    expansion-history      χ² ≈ 821.10

corresponding to

    Δχ² ≈ −13.

============================================================
6. EQUALITY-TIED ACTIVATION RESULTS
============================================================

For

    u_s = α u_eq

the preferred parameters are

    H0 ≈ 74.57 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹  
    Ωm ≈ 0.229  
    α  ≈ 0.48

implying

    z_eq ≈ 0.49  
    z_s ≈ 0.21.

============================================================
7. LINEAR GROWTH TEST
============================================================

Linear growth obeys

    D'' + [2 + d ln H / d ln a] D'
       − (3/2) Ωm(a) D = 0.

Observed

    fσ8(z) = σ8,0 f(z) D(z).

Fits give

    ΛCDM           χ² ≈ 14.21  
    MTS baseline   χ² ≈ 12.52  
    equality-tied  χ² ≈ 12.63.

============================================================
8. JOINT COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS
============================================================

Joint inference combining supernovae, BAO, growth, and CMB acoustic
scale explores the parameter set

    {H0, Ωm, α, ν, rd}.

Optimization converges to

    H0   = 72.32  
    Ωm   = 0.231  
    α    = 0.482  
    ν    = 0.886  
    rd   = 154.31 Mpc.

Likelihood decomposition:

                SN        BAO       Growth      CMB      Total
----------------------------------------------------------------
Best-fit MTS  809.15     11.91      11.76       0.00     832.83

The acoustic scale is reproduced accurately

    ℓ_A ≈ 301.47.

============================================================
8.4 Sensitivity to the activation exponent
============================================================

Exploratory scans previously suggested values between

    ν ≈ 0.82 – 0.94.

Allowing ν to vary freely in the full joint inference yields

    ν ≈ 0.886.

This value lies between the galactic mastercurve estimate
(ν ≈ 0.942) and the cosmology-only minimum (ν ≈ 0.82).

============================================================
9. EFFECTIVE DARK-ENERGY INTERPRETATION
============================================================

The model can be written

    H^2(z) = H0^2 [ Ωm (1+z)^3 + ρ_DE^eff(z) ]

with

    ρ_DE^eff(z)
      = (1 − Ωm) − Ωm (1+z)^3 [1 − g(z)].

Equation of state

    w_eff(z)
      = -1 + (1+z)/(3ρ_DE^eff) dρ_DE^eff/dz.

============================================================
10. LIMITING REGIMES
============================================================

Early time

    g(z) → 1.

Present epoch

    g(0) = 0.

Small redshift

    g(z) ≈ (z/u_s)^ν.

============================================================
11. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
============================================================

The activation function

    g(u) = 1 − exp(−u^ν)

is equivalent to the cumulative response of a Weibull threshold
ensemble.

The loading variable

    u(z) = ln(1+z)/u_s

represents accumulated expansion history.

The activation factor therefore corresponds to the fraction of
curvature-memory domains activated by cumulative cosmological exposure.

============================================================
12. CONCLUSIONS
============================================================

We have investigated a cosmological model in which the effective
contribution of the matter sector to the expansion history is
modulated by a stretched-exponential activation law.

Main results:

• Pantheon+ and DESI favour the activation model by Δχ² ≈ −13.

• Activation transition  
      z_s ≈ 0.21.

• Full joint inference yields

      H0 ≈ 72.32  
      Ωm ≈ 0.231  
      α  ≈ 0.482  
      ν  ≈ 0.886  
      rd ≈ 154.31 Mpc.

• Total likelihood

      χ²_total ≈ 832.83.

The activation cosmology therefore provides a compact description of
late-time expansion in which the effective gravitational influence of
the matter sector evolves in response to accumulated expansion history.
Further work will explore the deeper theoretical origin of the
activation law and its implications for early-universe physics.
