ABSTRACT
============================================================

We investigate a phenomenological cosmological framework in which the
effective contribution of the matter sector to the late-time expansion
history is modulated by an activation function derived from accumulated
cosmological expansion history.

The Friedmann background is modified through a multiplicative
activation factor g(z) applied to the matter density,

    H(z)^2 = H0^2 [ Ωm (1+z)^3 g(z) + (1 − Ωm) ].

Three closely related representations of the activation law are
considered:

1. empirical redshift activation
2. expansion-history activation using u = ln(1+z)
3. equality-tied activation linking the activation scale to the
   matter–Λ equality epoch.

The models are tested against the Pantheon+ SH0ES Type Ia supernova
sample, DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, the
Gold-2017 growth-rate compilation, and a CMB acoustic-scale constraint.

A full joint inference over the parameter set

    {H0, Ωm, α, ν, rd}

yields the best-fit activation cosmology

    H0 ≈ 72–76 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹
    Ωm ≈ 0.231
    α  ≈ 0.483
    ν  ≈ 0.886
    rd ≈ 147–155 Mpc

with total likelihood

    χ²_total ≈ 832.8.

The activation transition occurs at

    z_s ≈ 0.21,

following matter–Λ equality at

    z_eq ≈ 0.49.

A minimal perturbation closure predicts excessive clustering
amplitude S8 ≈ 1.15. Introducing a small residual perturbation
floor

    Ωm,pert ∝ g(z) + ε

with ε ≈ 0.065–0.09 lowers the predicted amplitude to

    S8 ≈ 0.79–0.88

while leaving the background expansion essentially unchanged.

These results suggest that late-time cosmic expansion may be
describable as a delayed response to accumulated expansion history
rather than as the consequence of a strictly constant dark-energy
component.

1. INTRODUCTION
============================================================

The standard ΛCDM cosmological model describes the late-time expansion
of the Universe through cold matter and a constant vacuum-energy
density.

Although ΛCDM provides an excellent phenomenological description of a
wide range of observations, the physical origin of the cosmological
constant remains uncertain.

In this work we investigate an alternative phenomenological framework
in which the effective gravitational contribution of the matter sector
is modulated by a delayed activation process governed by accumulated
expansion history.

The modified Friedmann equation is

    H(z)^2 = H0^2 [ Ωm (1+z)^3 g(z) + (1 − Ωm) ].

When

    g(z) = 1,

the model reduces to the standard ΛCDM background.

============================================================
2. ACTIVATION FRAMEWORK
============================================================

We consider a stretched-exponential activation law

    g(z) = 1 − exp[ −u(z)^ν ],

where ν is a shape parameter and u(z) is a dimensionless loading
variable describing accumulated expansion history.

------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Empirical redshift activation
------------------------------------------------------------

The phenomenological form

    g(z) = 1 − exp[ −( z / (z_s x0) )^ν ]

introduces an activation scale z_s.

------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Expansion-history activation
------------------------------------------------------------

A physically motivated loading variable is

    u(z) = ln(1+z) / u_s

giving

    g(z) = 1 − exp[ −( ln(1+z) / u_s )^ν ].

------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Equality-tied activation
------------------------------------------------------------

Matter–Λ equality satisfies

    Ωm (1+z_eq)^3 = 1 − Ωm.

This implies

    u_eq = (1/3) ln[(1 − Ωm)/Ωm].

The activation scale is parameterized as

    u_s = α u_eq.

============================================================
3. CONSTITUTIVE FORM OF THE ACTIVATION LAW
============================================================

Define the inactive fraction

    S(u) = 1 − g(u)

and introduce the hidden memory amplitude

    M(u) = −ln[1 − g(u)].

If the hidden load obeys

    M(u) = u^ν

then

    g(u) = 1 − exp(−u^ν).

Differentiating yields

    dg/du = ν u^(ν−1) (1 − g).

This is a first-order saturating activation equation.

The same functional form appears if activation thresholds follow a
Weibull survival distribution

    P(λ > u) = exp(−u^ν).

============================================================
4. OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS
============================================================

Pantheon+ SH0ES
    1701 Type Ia supernovae providing distance moduli μ(z).

DESI DR1 BAO
    measurements of DM/rd, DH/rd and DV/rd.

Gold-2017 growth
    18 measurements of fσ8(z).

CMB acoustic-scale constraint
    ℓ_A ≈ 301.47.

The combined likelihood is

    χ²_total = χ²_SN + χ²_BAO + χ²_growth + χ²_CMB.

============================================================
5. EXPANSION-HISTORY FITS
============================================================

Joint Pantheon+ and DESI analysis gives

    ΛCDM baseline          χ² ≈ 834
    activation models      χ² ≈ 821

corresponding to

    Δχ² ≈ −13.

============================================================
6. EQUALITY-TIED ACTIVATION RESULTS
============================================================

For

    u_s = α u_eq

the preferred parameters are

    Ωm ≈ 0.231
    α  ≈ 0.48
    ν  ≈ 0.886

implying

    z_eq ≈ 0.49
    z_s  ≈ 0.21.

============================================================
7. LINEAR GROWTH TEST
============================================================

Linear growth obeys

    D'' + [2 + d ln H / d ln a] D'
       − (3/2) Ωm(a) D = 0.

Observed

    fσ8(z) = σ8,0 f(z) D(z).

Fits give

    ΛCDM           χ² ≈ 14
    activation     χ² ≈ 12.6.

============================================================
8. JOINT COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS
============================================================

Joint inference combining supernovae, BAO, growth, and the CMB acoustic
scale explores

    {H0, Ωm, α, ν, rd}.

Best-fit example

    H0   ≈ 72–76
    Ωm   ≈ 0.231
    α    ≈ 0.483
    ν    ≈ 0.886
    rd   ≈ 147–155.

Total likelihood

    χ²_total ≈ 832.8.

============================================================
9. EFFECTIVE DARK-ENERGY INTERPRETATION
============================================================

The model can be written

    H^2(z) = H0^2 [ Ωm (1+z)^3 + ρ_DE^eff(z) ]

with

    ρ_DE^eff(z)
      = (1 − Ωm) − Ωm (1+z)^3 [1 − g(z)].

Equation of state

    w_eff(z)
      = -1 + (1+z)/(3ρ_DE^eff) dρ_DE^eff/dz.

============================================================
10. LIMITING REGIMES
============================================================

Early time

    g(z) → 1.

Present epoch

    g(0) = 0.

Small redshift

    g(z) ≈ (z/u_s)^ν.

============================================================
11. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
============================================================

The activation function

    g(u) = 1 − exp(−u^ν)

is equivalent to the cumulative response of a Weibull threshold
ensemble.

The loading variable

    u(z) = ln(1+z)/u_s

represents accumulated expansion history.

The activation factor therefore corresponds to the fraction of
curvature-memory domains activated by cumulative cosmological exposure.

============================================================
12. PERTURBATION-SECTOR EXTENSION
============================================================

The minimal activation framework assumes that the perturbation source
scales directly with the background activation factor

    Ωm,pert ∝ g(z).

This implies

    Ωm,pert(0) = 0,

causing excessive clustering amplitude.

Introducing a residual perturbation floor

    Ωm,pert ∝ g(z) + ε

with

    ε ≈ 0.065–0.09

maintains a small late-time clustering source.

This modification reduces the predicted clustering amplitude to

    S8 ≈ 0.79–0.88

while leaving the background expansion history essentially unchanged.


============================================================
13. DERIVATION OF THE ACTIVATION LAW FROM A THRESHOLD ENSEMBLE
============================================================

The activation function used throughout this work,

    g(u) = 1 − exp(−u^ν),

can be interpreted as the cumulative response of an ensemble of
domains that activate once a cumulative loading variable exceeds a
local threshold.

------------------------------------------------------------
13.1 Threshold ensemble description
------------------------------------------------------------

Consider a population of curvature-response domains indexed by i,
each characterized by an activation threshold λ_i.

Activation occurs when the cumulative loading variable u exceeds the
local threshold,

    u ≥ λ_i.

The macroscopic activated fraction of domains is therefore

    g(u) = P(λ ≤ u),

where P is the cumulative distribution function of the threshold
ensemble.

Equivalently, the inactive fraction is

    1 − g(u) = P(λ > u).

------------------------------------------------------------
13.2 Weibull threshold distribution
------------------------------------------------------------

If the activation thresholds follow a Weibull distribution, the
survival probability of the threshold ensemble is

    P(λ > u) = exp(−u^ν),

where ν is the shape parameter describing the breadth of the threshold
distribution.

The cumulative activated fraction becomes

    g(u) = 1 − exp(−u^ν).

Thus the stretched-exponential activation law arises naturally as the
cumulative response of a heterogeneous threshold ensemble.

------------------------------------------------------------
13.3 Interpretation of the exponent
------------------------------------------------------------

The exponent ν characterizes the distribution of activation
thresholds.

For

    ν = 1

the activation law reduces to a simple exponential response with a
single characteristic activation scale.

For

    ν < 1

the activation becomes stretched exponential, indicating a broad
distribution of thresholds and a delayed cumulative activation
process.

The cosmological fits obtained in this work give

    ν ≈ 0.886,

placing the system within the stretched-exponential regime.

------------------------------------------------------------
13.4 Cosmological loading variable
------------------------------------------------------------

To apply the threshold ensemble framework to cosmology we introduce a
loading variable measuring accumulated expansion history,

    u(z) = ln(1+z) / u_s.

The parameter u_s sets the characteristic loading scale.

In the equality-tied formulation used here the scale is related to
the matter–Λ equality epoch,

    u_s = α u_eq

with

    u_eq = (1/3) ln[(1 − Ω_m)/Ω_m].

------------------------------------------------------------
13.5 Activated curvature-domain fraction
------------------------------------------------------------

Combining the threshold ensemble with the cosmological loading
variable yields

    g(z) = 1 − exp[−( ln(1+z) / u_s )^ν].

The activation fraction therefore describes the proportion of
curvature-response domains participating in the effective matter
sector at redshift z.

------------------------------------------------------------
13.6 Background interpretation
------------------------------------------------------------

The Friedmann equation becomes

    H^2(z) = H0^2 [ Ω_m (1+z)^3 g(z) + (1 − Ω_m) ].

At high redshift

    u → ∞
    g → 1

and the standard matter-dominated behaviour is recovered.

At late times the activated fraction decreases, producing a reduced
effective matter contribution and an apparent dark-energy component.

============================================================
14. CONCLUSIONS
============================================================

We have investigated a cosmological framework in which the effective
contribution of the matter sector to the expansion history is
modulated by a stretched-exponential activation law.

Main results:

• Pantheon+ and DESI favour the activation model by Δχ² ≈ −13.

• Activation transition

      z_s ≈ 0.21.

• Joint inference yields

      Ω_m ≈ 0.231
      α  ≈ 0.483
      ν  ≈ 0.886.

• Total likelihood

      χ²_total ≈ 832.8.

• Introducing a small perturbation floor

      ε ≈ 0.065–0.09

  resolves the clustering-amplitude excess while leaving the
  background expansion essentially unchanged.

The activation cosmology therefore provides a compact description of
late-time expansion in which the effective gravitational influence of
the matter sector evolves in response to accumulated expansion
history.

Further work will investigate the deeper theoretical origin of the
activation mechanism and its implications for early-universe physics.
