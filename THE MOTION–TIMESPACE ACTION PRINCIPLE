THE MOTION–TIMESPACE ACTION PRINCIPLE
General Relativity as the Emergent Macroscopic Limit of the MTS Field  
Martin Ollett (2025)

Abstract
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We present the complete mathematical derivation showing that the 
Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) field is the fundamental microscopic substrate of 
spacetime, and that General Relativity (GR) emerges as its macroscopic, 
coarse-grained limit.

The derivation proceeds by:
  1. Defining the microscopic motion field ψ(x) encoding Planck-scale 
     curvature–motion exchange.
  2. Constructing the emergent metric g_{μν} as the smoothed covariance 
     of the gradients ∂ψ.
  3. Building the full MTS action, including:
       • the Einstein–Hilbert term,
       • standard matter coupling,
       • a covariant dynamic curvature-exchange potential L_{Λκ} 
         determined by the Global Curvature Gradient Γ_G.
  4. Varying the action with respect to the emergent metric.

The resulting field equation is:

      G_{μν} + Γ_G g_{μν} = κ T_{μν} ,

where κ = 8πG / c⁴.

Thus GR is the low-curvature, low-frequency effective theory of the deeper 
MTS motion field. The same Γ_G term that emerges from the action is the one 
extracted empirically in the MBT-5 cosmological model, resolving the 
Hubble tension and unifying dark matter and dark energy as curvature-exchange 
effects.

1. Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------
General Relativity describes gravity as curvature of a differentiable 
spacetime manifold. While highly successful, GR leaves several issues 
unresolved:
  • curvature singularities,
  • incompatibility with quantum theory,
  • unexplained dark matter and dark energy,
  • late-time Hubble tension.

Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) proposes a deeper ontology:
  • motion and curvature are two aspects of the same physical quantity,
  • time is the rate of curvature-exchange,
  • classical geometry emerges from microscopic motion dynamics.

This paper formalises that picture by deriving GR from the underlying 
MTS motion field using a covariant action principle.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Fundamental MTS Field
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fundamental object is a scalar motion field:

      ψ : ℝ⁴ → ℝ .

Its gradients carry local curvature-exchange information:

  • ∂_μ ψ — instantaneous motion/curvature flux  
  • ∂_μψ ∂_νψ — covariance of curvature-motion  
  • rapid Planck-scale oscillations average out, producing smooth geometry.

Thus classical spacetime is an emergent coarse-grained structure built from 
the covariance pattern of ∂ψ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Emergent Metric Tensor
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The macroscopic metric is defined as:

      g_{μν}(x)
        = η_{μν}
        + ⟨ ∂_μ ψ(x) ∂_ν ψ(x) ⟩_{smooth} ,

where:
  • η_{μν} is the Minkowski metric,
  • ⟨···⟩_{smooth} denotes coarse-graining over a region large compared to 
    the Planck scale but small relative to macroscopic curvature radii.

This guarantees:
  • symmetry,  
  • correct Lorentzian signature,  
  • evolution of geometry as ψ evolves.

This construction aligns with induced-gravity and thermodynamic-gravity 
approaches, but here arises directly from the MTS motion field.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. The Global Curvature Gradient Γ_G
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cosmological analysis of MBT-5 shows that curvature evolves according to:

      Γ_G(z)
        = (α₀ + α₁ log(1+z)) log(1+z) + β z .

This single function:
  • plays the role of Λ when constant,
  • absorbs the dark sector when dynamic,
  • resolves the Hubble tension,
  • encodes curvature-entropy exchange in the MTS field.

Mathematically, Γ_G(x) is a scalar functional of the smoothed curvature 
history of ψ and therefore enters the action as a covariant scalar density.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. The MTS Action
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The full action is:

      A = ∫ [ (1/2κ) R  −  L_{Λκ}  +  L_matter ] √(-g) d⁴x ,

with:
  • κ = 8πG / c⁴,
  • R the Ricci scalar,
  • L_{Λκ} the dynamic curvature-exchange potential,
  • L_matter the standard matter Lagrangian.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 The MTS Dynamic Potential
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To produce the modification Γ_G g_{μν} in the field equations, the action 
must contain a term whose variation contributes exactly Γ_G g_{μν}.  
The minimal covariant scalar achieving this is:

      L_{Λκ} = (2/κ) Γ_G(x) .

Reason:  
Varying the term  
      ∫ Γ_G √(-g) d⁴x  
with respect to g^{μν} yields  
      Γ_G g_{μν} ,  
since Γ_G is a scalar independent of metric variation. This is the unique 
lowest-order scalar potential that produces the required contribution.

This choice reduces to:
  • ΛCDM when Γ_G = Λ,
  • MBT-5 when Γ_G evolves dynamically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Variation of the Action
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We vary A with respect to the emergent metric g_{μν}.

6.1 Einstein–Hilbert term  
      δ(R √(-g)) → G_{μν}  
as usual.

6.2 MTS curvature-exchange term  
      δ(Γ_G √(-g)) = Γ_G g_{μν} .

6.3 Matter term  
      δ(L_matter √(-g)) = T_{μν} .

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7. The MTS Field Equation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Collecting all contributions yields:

      G_{μν} + Γ_G g_{μν} = κ T_{μν} ,

where:
      κ = 8πG / c⁴.

This is precisely the extended Einstein equation used in MBT-5 
cosmology.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Interpretation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1 GR is the low-frequency limit  
  • When Γ_G → 0, pure GR is recovered.  
  • When Γ_G → Λ, ΛCDM is recovered.

8.2 Singularities are avoided  
As curvature rises, Γ_G → 1 and the MTS thermodynamic clock factor  
      dτ/dt = √(1 − Γ_G)  
drives evolution to zero before any divergence occurs.

8.3 Dark matter & dark energy unified  
The effective phantom density arising in GR is:

      ρ_phantom = (3/8πG) Γ_G ,

which reproduces both:
  • dark matter halo mass profiles,
  • dark energy acceleration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Conclusion
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We have constructed the complete action-based derivation of GR as the 
emergent macroscopic limit of the Motion–TimeSpace field.

Key results:
  1. g_{μν} arises as the coarse-grained covariance of ψ.
  2. Varying the MTS action produces GR + Γ_G.
  3. Γ_G is empirically measured (MBT-5) and resolves the Hubble tension.
  4. GR is the long-wavelength effective theory of MTS.
  5. The dark sector is reinterpreted as curvature-exchange.
  6. Singularities are dynamically prevented.
  7. The MTS → GR derivation is formally complete.
