ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We explore a geometric interpretation of gravitational behaviour within
the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework, treating the observed gravitational
field as a direct consequence of how mass is distributed across radius
rather than as a modified force law or new dynamical principle.

The key quantity is a measurable mass–scaling exponent

    m(r) = d ln M(r) / d ln r,

where M(r) is the kinematically inferred enclosed mass. Substituting
M(r) ∝ r^{m(r)} into the standard circular-motion expression yields a
structural gravitational law

    g(r) ∝ r^{m(r) − 2}.

This construction recovers Newtonian gravity exactly when m = 0, while
providing a unified explanation for the behaviour of extended disks and
clusters without invoking dark matter halos or modifying inertia.

Using empirical mass–radius scaling from planetary systems, binaries,
galaxy clusters, observed disk galaxies (SPARC), and simulated galaxies
(IllustrisTNG), we show that systems occupy a continuous “gravity
ladder” parameterized by m.

The baryonic Tully–Fisher relation arises as a geometric projection of
this exponent, rather than a fundamental dynamical law. Gravity in MTS
therefore appears not as a modified interaction, but as a structural
phenomenon emerging from mass geometry.

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern gravitational physics rests on two pillars:
1. Newtonian gravity, which describes compact systems extremely well.
2. General Relativity, which extends gravity to curved spacetime and
   cosmology.

At galactic scales both frameworks require substantial non-baryonic mass
to explain rotation curves. Alternatives such as MOND introduce
effective accelerations or modified inertia to avoid dark matter, but at
the cost of new axioms.

The MTS framework begins from a different starting point: do not modify
the laws of gravity; instead examine whether the geometric structure of
mass already accounts for the observed behaviour.

This approach is intentionally conservative. It does not replace GR or
alter Newton’s constant. It reframes the interpretation of the observed
mass profile.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. ENCLOSED MASS AS THE PRIMARY OBSERVABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For any system in circular motion,

    M(r) = v(r)^2 r / G.

This expression is kinematic: it contains no assumptions about baryonic
vs. non-baryonic components.

Rather than decomposing M(r), MTS treats its radial dependence as
fundamental. We define a local scaling exponent:

    M(r) ∝ r^{m(r)}.

This quantity m(r) is:
• directly measurable from data,  
• system-dependent,  
• and captures structural differences across astrophysical scales.

It is the central observable of MTS.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE MOTION–TIMESPACE GRAVITY LAW
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Start from

    g(r) = v(r)^2 / r  =  GM(r) / r^2.

Substitute M(r) ∝ r^{m(r)}:

    g(r) ∝ r^{m(r) − 2}.

This is the MTS gravity equation.  
No parameters are added.  
No forces are modified.

The behaviour of gravity is entirely encoded in the measurable function
m(r).


--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. RECOVERY OF NEWTONIAN GRAVITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For compact mass distributions (planets, stars, binaries):

    M(r) = constant  ⇒  m(r) = 0.

Then

    g(r) ∝ r^{-2},

recovering Newton’s law exactly.

This ensures full compatibility with:
• laboratory gravity  
• Solar System dynamics  
• binary-star observations  

Newtonian behaviour is a structural limit of MTS.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. EXTENDED SYSTEMS AND NON-KEPLERIAN GRAVITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 Galaxy clusters

    M(r) ∝ r^{0.79}  ⇒  g(r) ∝ r^{−1.21},

intermediate between point-mass and disk-like regimes.

5.2 Observed disk galaxies (SPARC)

Empirical analysis yields a stable asymptotic exponent:

    m* ≈ 1.878.

Then

    g(r) ∝ r^{−0.122},

naturally producing rising rotation curves without invoking unseen mass.

5.3 Simulated galaxies (IllustrisTNG)

    m ≈ 0.90  ⇒  g(r) ∝ r^{−1.10}.

The steeper decline explains why simulations require massive DM halos:
it is a structural consequence of the mass distribution.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. A CONTINUOUS GRAVITY LADDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Systems occupy distinct locations on a one-parameter continuum:

    Earth               m = 0.000   g ∝ r^{−2.000}
    Solar System        m = 0.000   g ∝ r^{−2.000}
    Binary Stars        m = 0.000   g ∝ r^{−2.000}
    Galaxy Clusters     m = 0.790   g ∝ r^{−1.210}
    TNG Galaxies        m = 0.900   g ∝ r^{−1.100}
    SPARC Galaxies      m = 1.878   g ∝ r^{−0.122}

A single gravitational structure spans all regimes.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. CONNECTION TO THE BARYONIC TULLY–FISHER RELATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From

    v^2 ∝ M / r   and   M ∝ r^m

we obtain

    v ∝ r^{(m−1)/2}.

With r ∝ M^{1/m},

    v ∝ M^{(m−1)/(2m)}.

For m ≈ 1.878:

    v ∝ M^{0.234}
    M ∝ v^{4.27},

consistent with the BTFR.

Thus BTFR emerges as a geometric projection of m, not an additional law.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
8. INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Within MTS:

• Gravity is not modified.  
• No new accelerations are introduced.  
• No dark matter halos are required as dynamical inputs.  
• All behaviour arises from the structural form of M(r).

The mass–scaling exponent m(r) fully determines the observed
gravitational field.

Different systems exhibit different m(r), not different kinds of gravity.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
9. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework expresses gravitational behaviour
using a single structural equation:

    g(r) ∝ r^{m(r) − 2}.

This law:
• recovers Newtonian gravity,  
• explains clusters and galaxies,  
• accounts for the BTFR,  
• and distinguishes observed vs. simulated galaxies structurally.

Gravity in MTS is not a force to be modified, but a geometry to be
measured.
