ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We present a formulation of gravity within the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS)
framework in which gravitational behavior is not governed by a modified
force law, but instead emerges from the geometric scaling structure of
enclosed mass. In MTS, the effective gravitational acceleration is fully
determined by a radial mass–scaling exponent m(r), defined through the
observationally inferred relation M(r) ∝ r^{m(r)}.

We show that a single gravitational equation,

    g(r) ∝ r^{m(r) − 2},

recovers Newtonian gravity exactly for compact systems (m = 0), while
naturally producing non-Keplerian galactic dynamics for extended disk
systems (m ≈ 1.878). Using measured mass–radius exponents from planets,
binaries, galaxy clusters, observed disk galaxies (SPARC), and simulated
galaxies (IllustrisTNG), we demonstrate a continuous gravity ladder
spanning over fifteen orders of magnitude in scale without modifying
gravitational laws or introducing dark matter halos.

Within this framework, the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation and rising
galaxy rotation curves emerge as algebraic projections of a geometric
fixed point rather than as fundamental dynamical laws. Gravity in MTS is
therefore identified as a structural phenomenon: universal in form, but
expressed differently depending on mass geometry.

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Gravity has historically been described either as a force (Newton), a
geometric curvature of spacetime (General Relativity), or as an effective
modification at low accelerations (MOND). Despite their success, these
approaches encounter persistent challenges when applied across all
astrophysical scales, particularly in explaining galaxy rotation curves
and the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR) without invoking finely
tuned dark matter distributions.

The Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework adopts a different perspective.
Rather than modifying gravitational dynamics or postulating unseen mass
components, MTS treats observed gravitational phenomena as emergent
consequences of how mass is geometrically distributed and coarse-grained
across scale.

In this paper, we formalize the gravity equation of MTS, demonstrate its
reduction to Newtonian gravity in local systems, and show how it
reproduces observed galactic behavior using a single structural
parameter.

2. ENCLOSED MASS AS THE PRIMARY GRAVITATIONAL OBSERVABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For any system exhibiting circular motion, the enclosed mass inferred
from observations is given by

    M(r) = v(r)^2 r / G.

This relation is purely kinematic and does not assume any particular mass
composition. In MTS, this inferred mass is not decomposed into baryonic
and non-baryonic components; instead, its radial scaling behavior is
treated as the primary gravitational diagnostic.

We define a local mass–scaling exponent m(r) by

    M(r) ∝ r^{m(r)}.

Unlike traditional approaches that assume a constant mass profile or
parametric halo models, MTS allows m(r) to vary with radius and across
systems.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. THE MTS GRAVITY EQUATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from the standard relation between gravitational acceleration
and circular velocity,

    g(r) = v(r)^2 / r,

and substituting the enclosed mass expression, we obtain

    g(r) = G M(r) / r^2.

Using the MTS mass–scaling definition M(r) ∝ r^{m(r)}, this yields the
MTS gravity law:

    g(r) ∝ r^{m(r) − 2}.

This equation is universal. No new forces are introduced and no
modification of Newton’s constant is required. All gravitational
behavior in MTS is encoded in the exponent m(r).


--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. RECOVERY OF NEWTONIAN GRAVITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For compact systems such as planets, stars, and binary systems, the
enclosed mass is effectively constant beyond the physical radius of the
object:

    M(r) = const  ⇒  m(r) = 0.

Substituting into the MTS gravity equation gives

    g(r) ∝ r^{−2},

recovering the inverse-square law exactly. Newtonian gravity therefore
appears as a special structural limit of MTS rather than as an
approximation.

This guarantees consistency with laboratory gravity, Solar System
dynamics, and binary-star observations.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. EXTENDED SYSTEMS AND NON-KEPLERIAN GRAVITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 Galaxy Clusters

Observations of galaxy clusters yield an approximate scaling

    M(r) ∝ r^{0.79},

implying

    g(r) ∝ r^{−1.21},

an intermediate regime between point-mass and disk-dominated systems.


5.2 Observed Disk Galaxies (SPARC)

Analysis of SPARC rotation curves shows that mature disk galaxies
converge toward a characteristic mass–scaling exponent

    m* ≈ 1.878.

The MTS gravity law then predicts

    g(r) ∝ r^{−0.122},

indicating a very slowly declining gravitational field that naturally
produces rising rotation curves without invoking dark matter halos or
modified inertia.


5.3 Simulated Galaxies (IllustrisTNG)

Galaxies formed in cosmological simulations exhibit

    m ≈ 0.90,

leading to

    g(r) ∝ r^{−1.10}.

This steeper decline explains why such simulations require massive dark
matter halos to sustain observed rotation curves. The discrepancy
between observed and simulated systems is therefore structural rather
than dynamical.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. A CONTINUOUS GRAVITY LADDER
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Measured mass–scaling exponents across systems produce the following
continuum:

    Earth              m = 0.000   g(r) ∝ r^{−2.000}
    Solar System       m = 0.000   g(r) ∝ r^{−2.000}
    Binary Stars       m = 0.000   g(r) ∝ r^{−2.000}
    Galaxy Clusters    m = 0.790   g(r) ∝ r^{−1.210}
    TNG Galaxies       m = 0.900   g(r) ∝ r^{−1.100}
    SPARC Galaxies     m = 1.878   g(r) ∝ r^{−0.122}

A single gravity equation spans all regimes without discontinuity.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. CONNECTION TO THE BARYONIC TULLY–FISHER RELATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

From virial equilibrium,

    v^2(r) ∝ M(r) / r.

With M(r) ∝ r^{m}, this implies

    v(r) ∝ r^{(m − 1)/2}.

Eliminating radius using r ∝ M^{1/m} yields

    v ∝ M^{(m − 1)/(2m)}.

For m* ≈ 1.878, this gives

    v ∝ M^{0.234},

which inverts to

    M ∝ v^{4.27},

consistent with the observed baryonic Tully–Fisher relation. The BTFR
thus emerges as an algebraic projection of the geometric fixed point.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
8. INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Within the Motion–TimeSpace framework:

• Gravity is not a modified force law.
• Gravity is not dark matter.
• Gravity is not an acceleration threshold.

Instead, gravity is the emergent expression of mass geometry, fully
encoded in the radial scaling exponent m(r). The gravitational law itself
is universal; apparent deviations arise solely from differences in
structural organization.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
9. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We have shown that gravity within Motion–TimeSpace can be expressed by a
single universal equation,

    g(r) ∝ r^{m(r) − 2},

where the mass–scaling exponent m(r) is directly measurable from
observational data. This formulation recovers Newtonian gravity exactly,
explains galaxy rotation curves without force modification, predicts the
baryonic Tully–Fisher relation, and exposes the structural shortcomings
of cosmological simulations.

Gravity in MTS is therefore not a force to be altered, but a geometric
structure to be measured.
