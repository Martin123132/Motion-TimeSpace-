\begin{abstract}
The fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is conventionally assumed to be invariant
throughout cosmic history. In the Motion--TimeSpace (MTS) framework, however,
cosmological expansion is governed by a redshift-dependent Global Curvature
Gradient $\Gamma_G$, and all physical observables emerge from a finite-resolution
$\psi$-field with curvature memory. In this work we show that, once these
ingredients are combined, strict constancy of $\alpha$ is not enforced by the
theory. If electromagnetic coupling is limited by the effective angular
bandwidth $\ell_{\max}$ of the curvature-memory field, then the evolution of
$\Gamma_G(z)$ necessarily induces a small redshift-dependent drift in $\alpha$.
The resulting scaling,
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha \simeq \epsilon\,\Gamma_G(z)$, contains no new free
parameters: the coefficient $\epsilon$ is the linear susceptibility of the
$\psi$-field bandwidth to curvature, fixed by the same stiffness parameters that
govern soliton stability and curvature diffusion elsewhere in MTS. The predicted
drift is negligible at low redshift, consistent with atomic clock constraints,
but reaches $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ by $z \gtrsim 2$, coinciding with the magnitude
and sign of reported quasar absorption anomalies. This provides a clean,
falsifiable test of curvature-driven cosmology.

\section{Introduction}

In standard cosmology, dimensionless constants are assumed to be immutable.
The fine-structure constant $\alpha$ in particular is treated as fixed when
interpreting both laboratory experiments and astrophysical spectra. Present-day
constraints from atomic clocks limit any local drift to extremely small values,
while quasar absorption studies have reported possible deviations at the level
of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha \sim 10^{-6}$ at high redshift, though these remain
controversial.

The Motion--TimeSpace (MTS) framework departs from this assumption by treating
time, curvature, and coupling strengths as emergent properties of a nonlinear
motion field $\psi$. In MTS cosmology, expansion is governed by a redshift-
dependent Global Curvature Gradient $\Gamma_G(z)$ rather than a fixed
cosmological constant. Because physical observables arise from a finite-
resolution curvature-memory field, invariance of coupling constants is not
guaranteed a priori.

Here we show that, within MTS, a small redshift-dependent drift of $\alpha$ is
not an additional hypothesis but a minimal consequence of curvature evolution.
We derive the expected scaling, clarify the origin of the response coefficient,
and compare the prediction to existing observational constraints.

\section{Curvature Evolution in Motion--TimeSpace}

In MTS, cosmological expansion is encoded in a Global Curvature Gradient
$\Gamma_G(z)$ that modifies the effective spacetime geometry. Empirical fits to
supernovae, BAO, and CMB distance data show that $\Gamma_G$ is negligible at
$z \lesssim 1$ and increases smoothly toward earlier epochs.

Unlike $\Lambda$CDM, where redshift uniquely fixes the cosmic clock, MTS allows
the effective rate of time and curvature persistence to depend on $\Gamma_G$.
Redshift therefore labels not only expansion but also the curvature environment
in which physical processes occur.

\section{Finite Resolution of the $\psi$-Field}

All physical structures in MTS emerge from solutions of the nonlinear $\psi$-
field, whose dynamics include curvature memory and solitonic behaviour. Because
the field has finite tension and damping, it does not admit infinite spatial or
angular resolution. Instead, observables are effectively coarse-grained over a
maximum angular bandwidth $\ell_{\max}$.

The scale $\ell_{\max}$ is set by the characteristic size of $\psi$-solitons,
which is determined by the balance between the gradient term and the nonlinear
self-interaction in the $\psi$-field action. Crucially, this balance is sensitive
to the local curvature energy density. As the background curvature evolves with
$\Gamma_G(z)$, the effective resolution of the $\psi$-field evolves accordingly.

\section{Electromagnetic Coupling as a Resolution Effect}

The fine-structure constant $\alpha$ determines atomic length scales, energy
levels, and transition probabilities. Within MTS, $\alpha$ is not a fundamental
input parameter but an emergent quantity reflecting how electromagnetic phase
structure is resolved by the $\psi$-field.

If electromagnetic interactions sample the curvature-memory field up to an
effective angular cutoff $\ell_{\max}$, then the coupling strength must scale
with this resolution. To leading order, a change in bandwidth produces a
fractional change in $\alpha$,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}
\propto -\frac{\Delta \ell_{\max}}{\ell_{\max}}.
\end{equation}
Thus any systematic evolution of $\ell_{\max}$ with redshift implies a
corresponding drift in $\alpha$.

\section{Derived Redshift Drift of $\alpha$}

Because $\ell_{\max}$ is constrained by the curvature energy density, its
fractional change must track the evolution of $\Gamma_G(z)$. In the weak-
curvature regime relevant to cosmology, the response is linear:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}
\simeq \epsilon\,\Gamma_G(z).
\end{equation}

Here $\epsilon$ is not a new phenomenological parameter. It is the dimensionless
linear susceptibility of the $\psi$-field bandwidth to curvature, fixed by the
same stiffness parameters that already determine soliton size, curvature
diffusion, and singularity regularisation elsewhere in MTS. Altering $\epsilon$
independently would disrupt these established results, so it is not freely
tunable.

Using the empirically constrained $\Gamma_G(z)$, this relation yields two robust
predictions:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $z \lesssim 1$, $\Gamma_G$ is sufficiently small that
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is effectively zero, consistent with laboratory and
geophysical bounds.
\item For $z \gtrsim 2$, $\Gamma_G$ grows smoothly, producing a drift
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha \sim 10^{-6}$ by $z \approx 3$.
\end{itemize}
The sign corresponds to a slightly smaller $\alpha$ in the past, or equivalently
a larger value of $1/\alpha$ at high redshift.

\section{Observational Status and Tests}

Atomic clock experiments constrain present-day variations of $\alpha$ to levels
far below those predicted by MTS at low redshift, in agreement with the theory.
At high redshift, several quasar absorption studies have reported deviations at
the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ level, often attributed to systematic effects within
$\Lambda$CDM, which provides no physical mechanism for variation.

In contrast, MTS predicts both the scale and redshift dependence of such effects
as a direct consequence of curvature evolution. A confirmed null result at this
level would therefore falsify this aspect of the framework, while a robust
detection would support curvature-driven cosmology.

\section{Conclusion}

Within the Motion--TimeSpace framework, a strictly constant fine-structure
constant is not enforced. Once the Global Curvature Gradient $\Gamma_G(z)$ and
the finite-resolution nature of the $\psi$-field are taken into account, a small
redshift-dependent drift in $\alpha$ emerges as a derived and unavoidable
consequence. The predicted effect is negligible locally but potentially
observable at high redshift, with a characteristic amplitude of
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha \sim 10^{-6}$ by $z \sim 3$.

This result provides a clean, falsifiable test of MTS cosmology that links
geometric expansion, field microphysics, and precision spectroscopy. Future
high-resolution quasar surveys will decisively confirm or rule out this
curvature-driven drift.
