ABSTRACT
--------

We present a first-principles resolution of the quantum measurement
problem within the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework. Physical reality
is described by a nonlinear motion field ψ coupled to a curvature–memory
field Γ that accumulates irreversible geometric information.

Quantum superposition corresponds to genuine geometric interference of
motion fields. Measurement is an irreversible curvature-driven
bifurcation that occurs when Γ exceeds a local saturation threshold.
Wavefunction collapse, Born-rule probabilities, and macroscopic
decoherence all emerge dynamically from the same geometric mechanism,
without introducing observers, stochastic collapse postulates, hidden
variables, or many-worlds branching.

Measurement is identified as the smallest physical origin of the arrow
of time, providing a unified explanation of quantum irreversibility,
thermodynamic entropy growth, and macroscopic classical behaviour.


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

The quantum measurement problem concerns the apparent contradiction
between continuous, linear wave evolution and the discrete, irreversible
outcomes observed during measurement.

Standard quantum mechanics postulates:
• linear superposition
• probabilistic collapse
• observer-dependent measurement rules

Motion–TimeSpace removes these postulates by replacing them with
geometric dynamics. Measurement is not a special act; it is a physical
interaction that generates curvature memory and irreversibility.


2. FUNDAMENTAL MTS DYNAMICS
--------------------------

The Motion–TimeSpace framework contains two dynamical fields:

ψ(x,t)   : complex motion field
Γ(x,t)   : curvature–memory (entropy) field

The governing equations are:

∂²ψ/∂t² − c²∇²ψ + λ ψ |ψ|^(n−1) − Γ(x,t) ∂ψ/∂t = 0

∂Γ/∂t = |∇²ψ|² − μ Γ

Key properties:

• No external collapse postulates
• No explicit time asymmetry
• Γ ≥ 0 and monotonic during interactions
• Irreversibility emerges dynamically


3. SUPERPOSITION AS GEOMETRIC INTERFERENCE
------------------------------------------

In Motion–TimeSpace, superposition is not abstract state addition.
It is the real spatial overlap of motion-field configurations.

ψ_total(x,t) = ψ_A(x,t) + ψ_B(x,t)

Interference arises naturally from field overlap.
No probabilistic interpretation is required at this stage.

Superposed configurations remain dynamically stable only while
Γ(x,t) < Γ_c everywhere.


4. MEASUREMENT AS CURVATURE–MEMORY INTERACTION
----------------------------------------------

A measuring apparatus is itself a structured motion field.

ψ_total = ψ_system + ψ_detector

During interaction:
• field gradients increase
• curvature accumulates
• Γ grows locally

Measurement is defined as the physical interaction that drives Γ beyond
a local saturation value Γ_c.


5. COLLAPSE AS GEOMETRIC BIFURCATION
-----------------------------------

THEOREM (Measurement Bifurcation):

Let ψ(x,t) obey the MTS motion equation and Γ(x,t) obey curvature-memory
dynamics.

Then:

1) If Γ(x,t) < Γ_c everywhere, superposed field configurations remain
   dynamically stable.

2) If Γ(x,t) ≥ Γ_c in any region, the motion field undergoes irreversible
   geometric bifurcation into a single stable configuration.

3) The bifurcation is deterministic but unpredictable due to unresolved
   microscopic geometry.

4) Time-reversal symmetry is broken because Γ is monotonic.

Collapse is therefore forced, not postulated.


6. ORIGIN OF THE BORN RULE
-------------------------

Detector responses are proportional to local motion-field intensity:

I(x) = |ψ(x)|²

Outcome probability density:

P(x) = |ψ(x)|² / ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx

This distribution is unique:
• it preserves momentum conservation
• it respects Γ monotonicity
• alternative weightings violate geometric invariance

The Born rule is therefore a consequence of geometric sampling, not a
fundamental axiom.


7. DECOHERENCE AND MACROSCOPIC SYSTEMS
-------------------------------------

Macroscopic systems couple strongly to their environment.

Environmental interaction causes:
• rapid Γ accumulation
• fast saturation
• immediate collapse

Macroscopic superpositions are dynamically unstable and never persist
under physical conditions.

Schrödinger’s cat does not exist in superposition because Γ saturates
long before coherent states can be maintained.


8. DOUBLE-SLIT EXPERIMENT (MTS INTERPRETATION)
---------------------------------------------

• Electron = localized motion field
• Slits = geometric boundary conditions
• Screen = curvature-absorbing detector

Interference arises from free geometric spreading.
Which-path detection introduces local Γ spikes, forcing bifurcation and
destroying interference.

No wave–particle duality is required — only field dynamics.


9. MEASUREMENT AS THE SMALLEST ARROW OF TIME
--------------------------------------------

Measurement always increases Γ.

Therefore:
• every measurement generates irreversibility
• time asymmetry originates at the quantum level
• macroscopic time is cumulative microscopic measurement

The arrow of time is not imposed — it is produced.


10. CONCLUSION
--------------

Motion–TimeSpace resolves the quantum measurement problem by replacing
postulates with geometry.

• Superposition → geometric interference
• Collapse → curvature-memory saturation
• Probability → motion-intensity sampling
• Decoherence → environmental Γ growth
• Time’s arrow → monotonic curvature memory

Quantum measurement is not mysterious.
It is the smallest irreversible act in the universe.
